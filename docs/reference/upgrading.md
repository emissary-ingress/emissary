# Upgrading Ambassador

Since Ambassador's configuration is entirely stored in annotations or a `ConfigMap`, no special process is necessary to upgrade Ambassador. If you're using the YAML files supplied by Datawire, you'll be able to upgrade simply by repeating the following `kubectl apply` commands.

First determine if Kubernetes has RBAC enabled:

```shell
kubectl cluster-info dump --namespace kube-system | grep authorization-mode
```

If you see something like `--authorization-mode=Node,RBAC` in the output, then RBAC is enabled.

If RBAC is enabled:
```shell
kubectl apply -f https://www.getambassador.io/yaml/ambassador/ambassador-rbac.yaml
```

If RBAC is not enabled:
```shell
kubectl apply -f https://www.getambassador.io/yaml/ambassador/ambassador-no-rbac.yaml
```

This will trigger a rolling upgrade of Ambassador.

If you're using your own YAML, check the Datawire YAML to be sure of other changes, but at minimum, you'll need to change the pulled `image` for the Ambassador container and redeploy.

## Upgrading to 0.50.0
Ambassador 0.50.0 adds the v1 API. All future Ambassador features will be created for the v1 API. Please refer to the [changelog](https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for information on all new features.

While for the most part, upgrading from v0 to v1 is as simple as changing the `apiVersion` in the resource definition, there are a couple of breaking changes that need to be addressed. 

**Rate Limiting**
The [rate_limits](/reference/rate-limits/) `Mapping` attribute is replaced by `labels` in the v1 API. Ambassador 0.50.0 requires the v1 `Mapping` API for rate limtiing. See the [rate limiting tutorial](/user-guide/rate-limiting-tutorial#v1-api) and [rate limits](/reference/rate-limits/) documentation for more information. 

**AuthService**
The v1 `AuthService` API adds a number of features that require configuration changes. Please refer to the [authentication documentation](/reference/services/auth-service) for more information on how to upgrade.
