# Ambassador on AWS

## Yaml Configuration

The following is a sample configuration for deploying Ambassador in AWS:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: ambassador
  namespace: {{ ambassador namespace }}
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert: "{{ tls certificate ARN }}"
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-ports: "443"
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: "tcp"
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-cross-zone-load-balancing-enabled: "true"
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-proxy-protocol: "*"
    getambassador.io/config: |
      ---
      apiVersion: ambassador/v1
      kind:  Module
      name:  ambassador
      config:
        use_proxy_proto: true
        use_remote_address: true
spec:
  externalTrafficPolicy: Local
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - name: ambassador
    port: 443
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    service: ambassador
```

In this configuration, an ELB is deployed with a multi-domain AWS Certificate Manager certificate. The ELB is configured to route TCP to support both WebSockets and HTTP. Ambassador is configured with `use_remote_address` and `use_proxy_proto` to ensure that remote IP addresses are passed through properly. TLS termination then occurs at the ELB.

## Helm Values Configuration

The following in a sample configuration for deploying Ambassador in AWS using Helm.

Create a values file with the following content:

`values.aws.yaml`
```yaml
service:
  http:
    enabled: true
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080

  https:
    enabled: true
    port: 443
    targetPort: 8443

  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert: "{{ tls certificate arn }}"
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-ports: "443"
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: "http"
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-cross-zone-load-balancing-enabled: "true"
    getambassador.io/config: |
      --- 
      apiVersion: ambassador/v1
      kind:  Module
      name:  ambassador
      config:
        use_proxy_proto: false
        use_remote_address: false
        x_forwarded_proto_redirect: true
```

Install with: 
```
helm repo add datawire https://www.getambassador.io/helm
helm install --name ambassador -f values.aws.yaml datawire/ambassador
```

In this configuration, an ELB is deployed with a multi-domain AWS Certificate Manager certificate. The ELB is configured to route in L7 mode, which means only HTTP(S) traffic is supported, and not web sockets. TLS termination occurs at the ELB. Automatic redirection of HTTP to HTTPS is enabled. Downstream services can extract the client IP from the `X-FORWARDED-FOR` header

## Ambassador and AWS load balancer notes

AWS provides three types of load balancers:

* "Classic" Load Balancer (abbreviated ELB or CLB, sometimes referred to as ELBv1 or Elastic Load Balancer)
  * Supports L4 (TCP, TCP+SSL) and L7 load balancing (HTTP 1.1, HTTPS 1.1)
  * Does not support WebSockets unless running in L4 mode
  * Does not support HTTP 2 (which is required for GRPC) unless running in L4 mode
  * Can perform SSL/TLS offload
* Application Load Balancer (abbreviated ALB, sometimes referred to as ELBv2)
  * Supports L7 only
  * Supports WebSockets
  * Supports a broken implementation of HTTP2 (trailers are not supported and these are needed for GRPC)
  * Can perform SSL/TLS offload
* Network Load Balancer (abbreviated NLB)
  * Supports L4 only
  * Cannot perform SSL/TLS offload

In Kubernetes, when using the AWS integration and a service of type `LoadBalancer`, the only types of load balancers that can be created are ELBs and NLBs (in Kubernetes 1.9 and later). When `aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol` is set to `tcp`, AWS will create a L4 ELB. When `aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol` is set to `http`, AWS will create a L7 ELB.

## TLS Termination

As with any Kubernetes environment, Ambassador can be configured to perform SSL offload by configuring a tls [`Module`](/reference/core/tls) or [`TLSContext`](/user-guide/sni). Refer to the [TLS Termination](/user-guide/tls-termination) documentation for more information. 

In AWS, you can also perform SSL offload with an ELB or ALB. If you choose to terminate TLS at the LB, Ambassador should be configured to listen for cleartext traffic on the default port 80. An example of this using an L4 ELB is shown at the top of this document. 

Enabling HTTP -> HTTPS redirection will depend on if your load balancer is running in L4 or L7 mode.

### L4 Load Balancer

When running an ELB in L4 mode, you will need to listen on two ports to redirect all incoming HTTP requests to HTTPS. The first port will listen for HTTP traffic to redirect to HTTPS, while the second port will listen for HTTPS traffic.

Let's say,
- port 80 on the load balancer forwards requests to port 80 on Ambassador
- port 443 on the load balancer forwards requests to port 443 on Ambassador



First off, configure this forwarding in your load balancer.

```yaml
spec:
  externalTrafficPolicy: Local
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - name: https
    port: 443
    targetPort: 443
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
```

Now, we want every request on port 80 to be redirected to port 443.

To achieve this, you need to use `redirect_cleartext_from` as follows -

```yaml
apiVersion: ambassador/v1
kind:  Module
name:  tls
config:
  server:
    enabled: True
    redirect_cleartext_from: 80
```

**Note:** Ensure there is no `ambassador-certs` secret in Ambassador's Namespace. If present, the tls `Module` will configure Ambassador to expect HTTPS traffic.

Editing the example service configuration above will give us:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: ambassador
  namespace: {{ ambassador namespace }}
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert: "{{ tls certificate ARN }}"
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-ports: "443"
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: "tcp"
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-cross-zone-load-balancing-enabled: "true"
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-proxy-protocol: "*"
    getambassador.io/config: |
      ---
      apiVersion: ambassador/v1
      kind:  Module
      name:  ambassador
      config:
        use_remote_address: true
        use_proxy_proto: true
      ---
      apiVersion: ambassador/v1
      kind: Module
      name: tls
      config:
        server:
          enabled: true
          redirect_cleartext_from: 80
spec:
  externalTrafficPolicy: Local
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - name: https
    port: 443
    targetPort: 443
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    service: ambassador
```

This configuration makes Ambassador start a new listener on 80 which redirects all cleartext HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

**Note:** Ambassador only supports standard ports (80 and 443) on the load balancer for L4 redirection, [yet](https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/issues/702)! For instance, if you configure port 8888 for HTTP and 9999 for HTTPS on the load balancer, then an incoming request to `http://<host>:8888` will be redirected to `https://<host>:8888`. This will fail because HTTPS listener is on port 9999.

### L7 Load Balancer

If you are running the load balancer in L7 mode, then you will want to redirect all the incoming HTTP requests without the `X-FORWARDED-PROTO: https` header to HTTPS. Here is an example Ambassador configuration for this scenario:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: ambassador
  namespace: {{ ambassador namespace }}
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert: "{{ tls certificate ARN }}"
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-ports: "443"
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: "http"
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-cross-zone-load-balancing-enabled: "true"
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-proxy-protocol: "*"
    getambassador.io/config: |
      ---
      apiVersion: ambassador/v1
      kind:  Module
      name:  ambassador
      config:
        use_proxy_proto: true
        use_remote_address: true
        x_forwarded_proto_redirect: true
spec:
  externalTrafficPolicy: Local
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - name: ambassador
    port: 443
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    service: ambassador
```
