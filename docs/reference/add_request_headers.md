# Add Request Headers

Ambassador can add a dictionary of HTTP headers that can be added to each request that is passed to a service.

## The `add_request_headers` annotation

The `add_request_headers` attribute is a dictionary of `header`: `value` pairs. Envoy dynamic values `%DOWNSTREAM_REMOTE_ADDRESS_WITHOUT_PORT%` and `%PROTOCOL%` are supported, in addition to static values.

## A basic example

```yaml
---
apiVersion: ambassador/v1
kind:  Mapping
name:  qotm_mapping
prefix: /qotm/
add_request_headers:
  x-test-proto: "%PROTOCOL%"
  x-test-ip: "%DOWNSTREAM_REMOTE_ADDRESS_WITHOUT_PORT%"
  x-test-static: This is a test header
service: qotm
```

will add the protocol, client IP, and a static header to `/qotm/`.
