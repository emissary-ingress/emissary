# Installing Ambassador Pro and Ambassador Dev Portal

<div class="ambassador-pro-banner">
All of the functionality previously available in Ambassador Pro is now available for free with the
Ambassador Edge Stack Community Edition! <a href="/editions">Click here to learn more â†’</a>
</div>

For users who need additional functionality, Datawire provides two add-on products to Ambassador:

* Pro, which adds additional security capabilities such as Single Sign-On, rate limiting, and JWT validation.
* Dev Portal, which provides a customizable developer portal that publishes your Swagger/OAPI API documentation.

Both of these products use a certified version of Ambassador that undergoes additional testing and validation.

Information about the open-source code used in Ambassador Pro and Dev Portal can be found in `/*.opensource.tar.gz` files in each Docker image. Both of these products are included in a single consolidated Docker image.

## 1. Clone the Reference Architecture
The Ambassador add-on products are typically deployed on the same pod as Ambassador. In addition, Redis is used for the rate limit service. In this installation, we'll start with the standard configuration, which is available here:

```
git clone https://github.com/datawire/pro-ref-arch
```

## 2. License Key

Copy `env.sh.example` to `env.sh`, and add your specific license key to the `env.sh` file.

This license key will be loaded into a Kubernetes secret that will be referenced by Ambassador.

**Note:** Ambassador Pro will not start without a valid license key.

## 3. Deploy Ambassador Pro

If you're on GKE, first, create the following `ClusterRoleBinding`:

```
kubectl create clusterrolebinding my-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=$(gcloud info --format="value(config.account)")
```

Then, deploy Ambassador Pro and Dev Portal:

```
make apply-ambassador
```

This `make` command will use `kubectl` to deploy Ambassador Pro and Dev Portal and a basic test configuration to the cluster.

Verify that Ambassador is running:

```
kubectl get pods | grep ambassador
ambassador-79494c799f-vj2dv            2/2       Running            0         1h
ambassador-pro-redis-dff565f78-88bl2   1/1       Running            0         1h
```

**Note:** If you are not deploying in a cloud environment that supports the `LoadBalancer` type, you will need to change the `ambassador/ambassador-service.yaml` to a different service type (e.g., `NodePort`).

By default, Ambassador Pro uses ports 8500-8503.  If for whatever
reason those assignments are problematic (perhaps you [set
`service_port`](/reference/running/#running-as-non-root) to one of
those), you can set adjust these by setting environment variables:

| Purpose                        | Variable         | Default |
| ---                            | ---              | ---     |
| Filtering AuthService (gRPC)   | `APRO_AUTH_PORT` | 8500    |
| RateLimitService (gRPC)        | `GRPC_PORT`      | 8501    |
| RateLimitService debug (HTTP)  | `DEBUG_PORT`     | 8502    |
| RateLimitService health (HTTP) | `PORT`           | 8503    |

If you have deployed Ambassador with
[`AMBASSADOR_NAMESPACE`, `AMBASSADOR_SINGLE_NAMESPACE`](/reference/running/#namespaces), or
[`AMBASSADOR_ID`](/reference/running/#ambassador_id)
set, you will also need to set them in the Pro container.

## 4. Developer Portal

To access the developer portal, you need to provide the IP address or hostname (and port if you are using a `NodePort` service) of the Ambassador service you just deployed. 

You can do this with `kubectl`:

```
kubectl get svc ambassador

NAME               TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                      AGE
ambassador-admin   ClusterIP      10.59.251.37    <none>          8877/TCP                     33m
ambassador         LoadBalancer   10.59.255.38    34.70.5.231     80:30529/TCP,443:30403/TCP   33m
```

Now provide this information to Ambassador by editing the value of `AMBASSADOR_URL` in your `env.sh` file and running the `make` command again.

`env.sh`:

```
AMBASSADOR_URL=https://34.70.5.231
```

```
make apply-ambassador
```

In your browser, go to $AMBASSADOR_IP/docs/. This will bring up the Dev Portal. The Dev Portal shows a list of all APIs in your cluster, along with the API documentation (if available). The Dev Portal supports rendering both Swagger and OpenAPI specifications. The look-and-feel of the Dev Portal is fully customizable.

## 5. Pro and JWT

We'll now walk through a few features of Pro. We'll start by configuring Ambassador Pro's JWT authentication filter.

```
make apply-jwt
```

This will configure the following `FilterPolicy`:

```
---
apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2
kind: FilterPolicy
metadata:
  name: httpbin-filterpolicy
  namespace: default
spec:
  # everything defaults to private; you can create rules to make stuff
  # public, and you can create rules to require additional scopes
  # which will be automatically checked
  rules:
  - host: "*"
    path: /jwt-httpbin/*
    filters:
    - name: jwt-filter
  - host: "*"
    path: /httpbin/*
    filters: null
```

Get the External IP address of your Ambassador service:

```
AMBASSADOR_IP=$(kubectl get svc ambassador -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
```

We'll now test Ambassador Pro with the `httpbin` service. First, curl to the `httpbin` URL This URL is public, so it returns successfully without an authentication token.

```
$ curl -k https://$AMBASSADOR_IP/httpbin/ip # No authentication token
{
  "origin": "108.20.119.124, 35.194.4.146, 108.20.119.124"
}
```

Send a request to the `jwt-httpbin` URL, which is protected by the JWT filter. This URL is not public, so it returns a 401.

```
$ curl -i -k https://$AMBASSADOR_IP/jwt-httpbin/ip # No authentication token
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
content-length: 58
content-type: text/plain
date: Mon, 04 Mar 2019 21:18:17 GMT
server: envoy
```

Finally, send a request with a valid JWT to the `jwt-httpbin` URL, which will return successfully.

```
$ curl -k --header "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJub25lIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ." https://$AMBASSADOR_IP/jwt-httpbin/ip
{
  "origin": "108.20.119.124, 35.194.4.146, 108.20.119.124"
}
```

## 6. Configure additional Ambassador Pro services

Ambassador Pro has many more features such as rate limiting, OAuth integration, and more.

### Enabling Rate limiting

For more information on configuring rate limiting, consult the [Advanced Rate Limiting tutorial ](/user-guide/advanced-rate-limiting) for information on configuring rate limits.

### Enabling Single Sign-On

For more information on configuring the OAuth filter, see the [Single Sign-On with OAuth and OIDC](/user-guide/oauth-oidc-auth) documentation.

### Enabling Service Preview

Service Preview requires a command-line client, `apictl`. For instructions on configuring Service Preview, see the [Service Preview tutorial](/docs/dev-guide/service-preview).

### Developer Portal reference

The Dev Portal can be customized for both content and look-and-feel. For details on using the Dev Portal, see the [Dev Portal Reference](/reference/dev-portal).

# Upgrading Ambassador Pro and Dev Portal

If you have an existing Ambassador installation, you can also upgrade directly to Ambassador Pro and Dev Portal.

**Note**: For simplicity, we recommend storing this license key in a Kubernetes secret that can be referenced by both the certified Ambassador and Ambassador Pro containers. You can do this with the following command.

```
kubectl create secret generic ambassador-pro-license-key --from-literal=key={{AMBASSADOR_PRO_LICENSE_KEY}}
```

1. Create the `ambassador-pro-license-key` secret using the command above.

2. Upgrade to the latest image of Ambassador Pro and Dev Portal:

    ```yaml
          - name: ambassador-pro
            image: quay.io/datawire/ambassador_pro:amb-sidecar-$aproVersion$
    ```

3. Change the image of the Ambassador container to use the certified version of Ambassador.

    ```diff
          containers:
          - name: ambassador
    -       image: quay.io/datawire/ambassador:$version$
    +       image: quay.io/datawire/ambassador_pro:amb-core-$aproVersion$
    ```

4. Add the `AMBASSADOR_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable to the Ambassador container and have it get its value from the secret created in step 1.

    ```yaml
            env:
            - name: AMBASSADOR_NAMESPACE
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.namespace
            - name: AMBASSADOR_LICENSE_KEY 
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: ambassador-pro-license-key
                  key: key
    ```
  
5. Ensure the `AMBASSADOR_LICENSE_KEY` in the Ambassador Pro/Portal container is also referencing the `ambassador-pro-license-key` secret.

    ```yaml
            env:
            - name: REDIS_SOCKET_TYPE 
              value: tcp
            - name: APP_LOG_LEVEL
              value: "info"
            - name: REDIS_URL 
              value: ambassador-pro-redis:6379
            - name: AMBASSADOR_LICENSE_KEY 
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: ambassador-pro-license-key
                  key: key
    ```

6. If using the Dev Portal, add the `AMBASSADOR_URL` and `APRO_DEVPORTAL_CONTENT_URL` environment variables to your container:

    ```yaml
            env:
            - name: AMBASSADOR_URL
              value: "https://example.com"
            - name: APRO_DEVPORTAL_CONTENT_URL
              value: "https://github.com/datawire/devportal-content"
    ```

After making these changes, redeploy Ambassador to receive the performance and stability improvements that certified Ambassador brings.
