# Deploying Ambassador to Kubernetes

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of deploying Ambassador in Kubernetes for ingress routing. Ambassador provides all the functionality of a traditional ingress controller (i.e., path-based routing) while exposing many additional capabilities such as [authentication](/user-guide/auth-tutorial), URL rewriting, CORS, rate limiting, and automatic metrics collection (the [mappings reference](/reference/mappings) contains a full list of supported options). For more background on Kubernetes ingress, [read this blog post](https://blog.getambassador.io/kubernetes-ingress-nodeport-load-balancers-and-ingress-controllers-6e29f1c44f2d).

Ambassador is designed to allow service authors to control how their service is published to the Internet. We accomplish this by permitting a wide range of annotations on the *service*, which Ambassador reads to configure its Envoy Proxy. Below, we'll use service annotations to configure Ambassador to map `/httpbin/` to `httpbin.org`.

## 1. Deploying Ambassador

To deploy Ambassador in your default namespace, run this command:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://getambassador.io/yaml/ambassador/ambassador.yaml
```

For production configurations, we recommend you download these YAML files as your starting point, and customize them accordingly (e.g., your namespace). 

Note: If you're using Google Kubernetes Engine with RBAC, you'll need to grant permissions to the account that will be setting up Ambassador. To do this, get your official GKE username, and then grant `cluster-admin` role privileges to that username:

```
$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding my-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=$(gcloud info --format="value(config.account)")
```

## 2. Defining the Ambassador Service

Ambassador is deployed as a Kubernetes service.  Create the following YAML and put it in a file called `ambassador-service.yaml`.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: ambassador
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
   - port: 80
  selector:
    service: ambassador
```

Deploy this service with `kubectl`:

```shell
$ kubectl apply -f ambassador-service.yaml
```

The YAML above creates a Kubernetes service for Ambassador of type `LoadBalancer`. All HTTP traffic will be evaulated against the routing rules you create. Note that if you're not deploying in an environment where `LoadBalancer` is a supported type, you'll need to change this to a different type of service, e.g., `NodePort`.

## 3. Creating your first route

Create the following YAML and put it in a file called `httpbin.yaml`.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: httpbin
  annotations:
    getambassador.io/config: |
      ---
      apiVersion: ambassador/v0
      kind:  Mapping
      name:  httpbin_mapping
      prefix: /httpbin/
      service: httpbin.org:80
      host_rewrite: httpbin.org
spec:
  ports:
  - name: httpbin
    port: 80
```

Then, apply it to the Kubernetes with `kubectl`:

```shell
$ kubectl apply -f httpbin.yaml
```

When the service is deployed, Ambassador will notice the `getambassador.io/config` annotation on the service, and use the `Mapping` contained in it to configure the route.  (There's no restriction on what kinds of Ambassador configuration can go into the annotation, but it's important to note that Ambassador only looks at annotations on Kubernetes `service`s.)

In this case, the mapping creates a route that will route traffic from `/httpbin/` to the public `httpbin.org` service. Note that we are using the `host_rewrite` attribute for the `httpbin_mapping` &mdash; this forces the HTTP `Host` header, and is often a good idea when mapping to external services. Ambassador supports [many different configuration options](/reference/configuration).

## 4. Testing the Mapping

To test things out, we'll need the external IP for Ambassador (it might take some time for this to be available):

```shell
kubectl get svc -o wide ambassador
```

Eventually, this should give you something like:

```
NAME         CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE
ambassador   10.11.12.13     35.36.37.38     80:31656/TCP   1m
```
You should now be able to use `curl` to `httpbin` (don't forget the trailing `/`):

```shell
$ curl 35.36.37.38/httpbin/
```

or on minikube: 

```shell
$ minikube service list
|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
|  NAMESPACE  |         NAME         |             URL             |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| default     | ambassador-admin     | http://192.168.99.107:30319 |
| default     | ambassador           | http://192.168.99.107:31893 |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
$ curl http://192.168.99.107:31893/httpbin/
```

## 5. Adding a Service

You can add a service just by deploying it with an appropriate annotation. For example, we can deploy the QoTM service locally in this cluster and automatically map it through Ambassador by creating `qotm.yaml` with the following:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: qotm
  annotations:
    getambassador.io/config: |
      ---
      apiVersion: ambassador/v0
      kind:  Mapping
      name:  qotm_mapping
      prefix: /qotm/
      service: qotm
spec:
  selector:
    app: qotm
  ports:
  - port: 80
    name: http-qotm
    targetPort: http-api
---
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: qotm
spec:
  replicas: 1
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: qotm
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: qotm
        image: datawire/qotm:1.1
        ports:
        - name: http-api
          containerPort: 5000
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "0.1"
            memory: 100Mi
```

and then applying it with

```
kubectl apply -f qotm.yaml
```

A few seconds after the QoTM service is running, Ambassador should be configured for it. Try it with

```shell
$ curl 35.36.37.38/qotm/
```

## 6. The Diagnostics Service in Kubernetes

Ambassador includes an integrated diagnostics service to help with troubleshooting. By default, this is not exposed to the Internet. To view it, we'll need to get the name of one of the Ambassador pods:

```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ambassador-3655608000-43x86   1/1       Running   0          2m
ambassador-3655608000-w63zf   1/1       Running   0          2m
```

Forwarding local port 8877 to one of the pods:

```
kubectl port-forward ambassador-3655608000-43x86 8877
```

will then let us view the diagnostics at http://localhost:8877/ambassador/v0/diag/.
