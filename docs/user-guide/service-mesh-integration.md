# Ambassador Service Mesh Integration

Ambassador is primarily focused on the north-south (ingress) traffic use case, and many engineers also want similar functionality for east-west (cross-service) traffic. This is typically provided by a "service mesh".

Ambassador integrates with a number of service meshes, and this section of the documentation provides details of how to configure Ambassador appropriately.
