# Security: Encryption and Authentication

Encryption like Transport-Level Security (TLS) and authentication at the edge of systems is essential with the current threat landscape, although implementing them can be non-trivial. Ambassador enables easy configuration of TLS termination, certificate rotation and associated Kubernetes configuration.

Ambassador also supports a range of authentication implementations, with a simple demonstration service provided within the open source Ambassador, and a more comprehensive OAuth/OIDC Authentication service provided within Ambassador Pro.
