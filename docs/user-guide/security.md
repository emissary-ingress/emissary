# Security Overview

Encryption like Transport-Level Security (TLS) and authentication at the edge of systems are essential with the current threat landscape, although implementing them can be non-trivial. Ambassador Edge Stack automatically enables HTTPS, and allows for easy configuration of TLS termination, certificate rotation, and associated Kubernetes configuration.

Ambassador Edge Stack also supports a range of authentication implementations, with a simple demonstration service provided within the Ambassador API Gateway, and a more comprehensive OAuth/OIDC Authentication service provided within Ambassador Edge Stack.
