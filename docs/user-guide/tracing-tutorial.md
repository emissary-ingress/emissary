# Distributed Tracing

Ambassador Edge Stack can support distributed tracing, one of the ["3 pillars of observability"](https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/monitoring-in-the-time-of-cloud-native-c87c7a5bfa3e), which allows developers to visualize request flows in microservice and service-oriented architectures. The following tutorials demonstrate using different tools for visualizing your traces.

## Tutorials

- [DataDog APM](../tracing-tutorial-datadog)
- [Zipkin](../tracing-tutorial-zipkin)
- [Monitoring Ingress](../monitoring) with Prometheus and Grafana

Also note that you can use the Ambassador Edge Stack as an [ingress controller](../../reference/core/ingress-controller).
