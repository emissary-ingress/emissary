# Ambassador Tutorial

In this article, you will explore some of the key features of the Ambassador
Edge Stack by walking through an example workflow and exploring the 
Edge Policy Console.

## Prerequisites

You must have [Ambassador Edge Stack installed](../getting-started/) in your 
Kubernetes cluster.

## Routing Traffic from the Edge

Like any other Kubernetes object, Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) are used to declaratively define Ambassadorâ€™s desired state. The workflow you are going to build uses a sample deployment and the `Mapping` CRD, which is the core resource that you will use with Ambassador to manage your edge. It enables you to route requests by host and URL path from the edge of your cluster to Kubernetes services.

1. Copy the configuration below and save it to a file named `quote.yaml` so that you can deploy these resources to your cluster. This basic configuration creates the `quote` deployment and a service to expose that deployment on port 80.

  ```yaml
  ---
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: quote
    namespace: ambassador
  spec:
    replicas: 1
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: quote
    strategy:
      type: RollingUpdate
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: quote
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: backend
          image: docker.io/datawire/quote:$quoteVersion$
          ports:
          - name: http
            containerPort: 8080
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: quote
    namespace: ambassador
  spec:
    ports:
    - name: http
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
    selector:
      app: quote
  ```

1. Apply the configuration to the cluster with the command `kubectl apply -f quote.yaml`.

1. Copy the configuration below and save it to a file called `quote-backend.yaml` 
so that you can create a `Mapping` on your cluster. This `Mapping` tells Edge 
Stack to route all traffic inbound to the `/backend/` path to the `quote` service. 

  ```yaml
  ---
  apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2
  kind: Mapping
  metadata:
    name: quote-backend
    namespace: ambassador
  spec:
    prefix: /backend/
    service: quote
  ```

1. Apply the configuration to the cluster with the command 
`kubectl apply -f quote-backend.yaml`

1. Store the Ambassador `LoadBalancer` address to a local environment variable.
You will use this variable to test accessing your pod.

  ```
  export AMBASSADOR_LB_ENDPOINT=$(kubectl -n ambassador get svc ambassador -o "go-template={{range .status.loadBalancer.ingress}}{{or .ip .hostname}}{{end}}")
  ```

1. Test the configuration by accessing the service through the Ambassador load 
balancer.

  ```
  $ curl -Lk "https://$AMBASSADOR_LB_ENDPOINT/backend/"
  {
   "server": "idle-cranberry-8tbb6iks",
   "quote": "Non-locality is the driver of truth. By summoning, we vibrate.",
   "time": "2019-12-11T20:10:16.525471212Z"
  }
  ```

Success, you have created your first Ambassador `Mapping`, routing a
request from your cluster's edge to a service! This is a diagram of the 
architecture you have created:

## Edge Policy Console

Next, you are going to log in to the Edge Policy Console to explore some of its
features. The console is a web-based interface that can be used to configure and
monitor Ambassador. 

1. Initially the console is accessed from the load balancer's hostname or public
address (depending on your Kubernetes environment). You stored this endpoint
earlier as a variable, echo that variable now to your terminal and make a note of it.

  ```
  echo $AMBASSADOR_LB_ENDPOINT
  ```

1. In your browser, navigate to `http://<load-balancer-endpoint>` and follow the
prompts to bypass the TLS warning. 

  > [A `Host` resource is created in production](../../topics/running/host-crd)
to use your own registered domain name instead of the load balancer endpoint to 
access the console and your `Mapping` endpoints.

1. The next page will prompt you to log in to the console using `edgectl`, the 
Ambassador CLI. The page provides instructions on how to install `edgectl` for 
all OSes and log in.

1. Once logged in, click on the **Mappings** tab in the Edge Policy Console. 
Scroll down to find an entry for the `quote-backend` `Mapping` that you created 
in your terminal with `kubectl`.

As you can see, the console lists the `Mapping` that you created earlier. This
information came from Ambassador polling the Kubernetes API. In 
Ambassador, Kubernetes serves as the single source of truth 
around cluster configuration. Changes made via `kubectl` are reflected in the 
Edge Policy Console and vice versa.  Try the following to see this in action.

1. Click **Edit** next to the `quote-backend` entry.

1. Change the **Prefix URL** from `/backend/` to `/quoteme/`.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Run `kubectl get mappings --namespace ambassador`. You will see the 
`quote-backend` `Mapping` has the updated prefix listed. Try to access the 
endpoint again via `curl` with the updated prefix.

  ```
  $ kubectl get mappings --namespace ambassador
  NAME            PREFIX      SERVICE   STATE   REASON
  quote-backend   /quoteme/   quote
   
  $ curl -Lk "https://${AMBASSADOR_LB_ENDPOINT}/quoteme/"
  {
      "server": "snippy-apple-ci10n7qe",
      "quote": "A principal idea is omnipresent, much like candy.",
      "time": "2020-11-18T17:15:42.095153306Z"
  }
  ```

1. Change the prefix back to `/backend/` so that you can later use the `Mapping` 
with other tutorials.

## Developer API Documentation

The `quote` service you just deployed publishes its API as an 
[OpenAPI (formally Swagger)](https://swagger.io/solutions/getting-started-with-oas/)
document. Ambassador automatically detects and publishes this documentation. 
This can help with internal and external developer onboarding by serving as a 
single point of reference for of all your microservice APIs.

1. In the Edge Policy Console, navigate to the **APIs** tab. You'll see the 
OpenAPI documentation there for the "Quote Service API." Click **GET** to
expand out the documentation.

1. Navigate to `https://<load-balancer-endpoint>/docs/` to see the 
publicly visible Developer Portal. Make sure you include the trailing `/`. 
This is a fully customizable portal that you can share with third parties who 
need information about your APIs.
