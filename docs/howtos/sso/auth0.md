# Auth0

With Auth0 as your IdP, you will need to create an `Application` to handle authentication requests from Ambassador Edge Stack.

1. Navigate to Applications and Select "CREATE APPLICATION"

2. In the pop-up window, give the application a name and create a "Machine to Machine App"

3. Select the Auth0 Management API. Grant any scopes you may require. (You may grant none.)

4. In your newly created application, click on the Settings tab, add the Domain and Callback URLs for your service and ensure the "Token Endpoint Authentication Method" is set to `Post`. The default YAML installation of Ambassador Edge Stack uses `/.ambassador/oauth2/redirection-endpoint` for the URL, so the values should be the domain name that points to Ambassador, e.g., `example.com/.ambassador/oauth2/redirection-endpoint` and `example.com`.

  Click Advanced Settings > Grant Types and check "Authorization Code"

## Configure Filter and FilterPolicy

Update the Auth0 `Filter` and `FilterPolicy`. You can get the `ClientID` and `secret` from your application settings:

   The `audience` is the API Audience of your Auth0 Management API:

   The `authorizationURL` is your Auth0 tenant URL.

   ```yaml
   ---
   apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2
   kind: Filter
   metadata:
     name: auth0_filter
     namespace: default
   spec:
     OAuth2:
       authorizationURL: https://datawire-ambassador.auth0.com
       clientURL: https://datawire-ambassador.com
       audience: https://datawire-ambassador.auth0.com/api/v2/
       clientID: fCRAI7svzesD6p8Pv22wezyYXNg80Ho8
       secret: CLIENT_SECRET
   ```

   ```yaml
   ---
   apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2
   kind: FilterPolicy
   metadata:
     name: httpbin-policy
     namespace: default
   spec:
     rules:
       - host: "*"
         path: /httpbin/ip
         filters:
           - name: auth0_filter ## Enter the Filter name from above
             arguments:
               scopes:
               - "openid"
   ```

  **Note:** By default, Auth0 requires the `openid` scope.
