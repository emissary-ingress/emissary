# Installing the Ambassador Edge Stack

The Ambassador Edge Stack can be installed in a variety of ways:

## Kubernetes

Kubernetes via YAML is the most common approach to install with our default, customizable manifest. The Ambassador Edge Stack is designed to run in Kubernetes for production. **If you're new to Kubernetes and/or Ambassador, we recommend using this method.**

See the [Quick Start](../../tutorials/getting-started) installation guide to
get started in just a few minutes.

You can also install the Ambassador Edge Stack using Helm, Docker, Bare Metal,
the Operator, or installing manually.

| Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. The Ambassador Edge Stack comes pre-packaged as a Helm chart. [Install via Helm.](helm) | The Docker install will let you try the Ambassador Edge Stack locally in seconds, but is not supported for production. [Try with Docker.](docker) | Bare Metal can expose the Ambassador Edge Stack if you don't have a load balancer in place. [Install on Bare Metal.](bare-metal) | The Ambassador Edge Stack Operator automates install and updates, among other actions. [Install with the Operator](aes-operator) | If you want to configure specific parameters of your installation, use the [YAML installation method](yaml-install). |
