# The Ambassador Edge Stack Operator

The Ambassador Edge Stack Operator is a Kubernetes Operator that controls the
complete lifecycle of Ambassador in your cluster. It also
automates many of the repeatable tasks you have to perform for the Ambassador
Edge Stack. Once installed, the AES Operator will automatically complete rapid
installations and seamless upgrades to new versions of Ambassador.  [Read
more](https://github.com/datawire/ambassador-operator/blob/master/README.md#version-syntax)
about the benefits of the Operator.

A Kubernetes operator is a software extension that makes it easier to manage and automate your
Kubernetes-based applications, in the spirit of a human operator. Operators complete actions such
as deploying, upgrading and maintaining applications, and many others. Read more about Kubernetes
Operators [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

This document covers installing the Operator:

* [Manually](#install-the-operator)
* via [Helm chart](#install-via-helm-chart)

And also shows how the Operator [automatically
updates](#updates-by-the-operator) versions.

## Install the Operator

Start by installing the operator:

1. Create the Operator Custom Resource schema with the following command:
   `kubectl apply -f https://github.com/datawire/ambassador-operator/releases/latest/download/ambassador-operator-crds.yaml`
2. Install the actual CRD for the Ambassador Operator in the `ambassador` namespace with the following command:
   `kubectl apply -n ambassador -f https://github.com/datawire/ambassador-operator/releases/latest/download/ambassador-operator.yaml`
3. To install the Ambassador Operator CRD in a different namespace, you can specify it in `NS` and
   then run the following command:

    ```shell
    $ NS="custom-namespace"
    $ curl -L https://github.com/datawire/ambassador-operator/releases/latest/download/ambassador-operator.yaml | \
        sed -e "s/namespace: ambassador/namespace: $NS/g" | \
        kubectl apply -n $NS -f -
    ```

Then, create the `AmbassadorInstallation` Custom Resource schema and apply it to the AES Operator.

1. To create the `AmbassadorInstallation` Custom Resource schema, use
   [the following YAML](https://github.com/datawire/ambassador-operator#the-operator-custom-resource-cr)
   as your guideline.
2. Save that file as `amb-install.yaml`
3. Edit the `amb-install.yaml` and optionally complete configurations such as Version constraint or UpdateWindow:
4. Finally, apply your `AmbassadorInstallation` CRD to the AES Operator schema
   with the following command: `kubectl apply -n ambassador -f amb-install.yaml`

### Configuration for the Ambassador Edge Stack

After the initial installation of Ambassador, the Operator will check for updates every 24 hours and
delay the update until the Update Window allows the update to proceed. It will use the Version Syntax for
determining if any new release is acceptable. When a new release is available and acceptable, the Operator
will upgrade Ambassador.

### Version Syntax and Update Window

To specify version numbers, use SemVer for the version number for any level of
precision. This can optionally end in `*`.  For example:

  * `1.0` = exactly version 1.0
  * `1.1` = exactly version 1.1
  * `1.1.*` = version 1.1 and any bug fix versions 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3, etc.
  * `2.*` = version 2.0 and any incremental and bug fix versions 2.0, 2.0.1, 2.0.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.2.1, etc.
  * `*` = all versions.
  * `3.0-ea` = version 3.0-ea1 and any subsequent EA releases on 3.0. Also selects the final 3.0 once the
    final GA version is released.
  * `4.*-ea` = version 4.0-ea1 and any subsequent EA release on 4.0. This also selects:
      * the final GA 4.0.
      * any incremental and bug fix versions 4.* and 4
      * the most recent 4.* EA release (i.e., if 4.0.5 is the last GA version and
        there is a 4.1-EA3, then this selects 4.1-EA3 over the 4.0.5 GA).

Read more about _SemVer_ [here](https://github.com/Masterminds/semver#basic-comparisons).

`updateWindow` is an optional item that will control when the updates can take
place. This is used to force system updates to happen during specified times.

There can be any number of `updateWindow` entries (separated by commas).
`Never` turns off automatic updates even if there are other entries in the
comma-separated list. `Never` is used by sysadmins to disable all updates during
blackout periods by doing a `kubectl` apply or using our Edge Policy Console to
set this.

Each `updateWindow` is in crontab format (see https://crontab.guru/) Some
examples of `updateWindow` are:

* `0-6 * * * SUN`: every Sunday, from 0am to 6am
* `5 1 * * *`: every first day of the month, at 5am

The Operator cannot guarantee minute time granularity, so specifying a minute in the crontab
expression can lead to some updates happening sooner/later than expected.

## Customizing the installation with some Helm values

`helmValues` is an optional map of configurable parameters of the Ambassador chart
with some overriden values. Take a look at the [current list of values](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/ambassador#configuration)
and their default values.

You must take into account some rules when settings these values in the `AmbassadorInstallation`:

  * All the values must be encoded as strings. This is specially important for integers (ie, use `"80"`
    instead of just `80`).
  * You must use a backslash to escape the `,` characters:
    ```yaml
    helmValues:
      name: "value1\,value2"
    ```
    You must escape _dot_ sequences as well, which may come in handy when charts use the `toYaml`
    function to parse annotations, labels and node selectors. So you must use:
    ```yaml
    # this is valid
    helmValues:
      nodeSelector.kubernetes\.io/role: master
    ```
    instead of:
    ```yaml
    # this is NOT valid
    helmValues:
      nodeSelector:
        kubernetes.io/role: master
    ```
  * Complex data structures must be _collapsed_, using dots for separating all the elements in a tree
    and `[]` for creating lists. For example, you should use:
    ```yaml
    # this is valid
    helmValues:
      service.ports[0].name: "http"
      service.ports[0].port: "80"
      service.ports[0].targetPort: "8080"
      service.ports[1].name: "https"
      service.ports[1].port: "443"
      service.ports[1].targetPort: "8443"
    ```
    instead of:
    ```yaml
    # this is NOT valid
    helmValues:
      service:
        ports:
        - name: http
          port: 80
          targetPort: 8080
        - name: https
          port: 443
          targetPort: 8443
    ```

## Install via Helm Chart

You can also install the AES Operator from a Helm Chart. The following Helm values are supported:

* `image.name`: Operator image name
* `image.pullPolicy`: Operator image pull policy
* `namespace`: namespace in which to install the Operator

**To do so:**

1. Add the Helm repository to your Helm client with `helm repo add datawire https://getambassador.io`
2. Run the following command: `helm install datawire/ambassador-operator`
3. Once the new Operator is working, create a new CRD called `AmbassadorInstallation` based on the following YAML:

    ```yaml
    $ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -n ambassador -f -
    apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2
    kind: AmbassadorInstallation
    metadata:
      name: ambassador
    spec:
      version: 1.2.0
    EOF
    ```

## Updates by the Operator

After the `AmbassadorInstallation` is created for the first time, the Operator
will then use the list of releases available for the Ambassador Helm Chart for
determining the most recent version that can be installed, using the optional
Version Syntax for filtering the releases that are acceptable.

It will then install Ambassador, using any extra arguments provided in the `AmbassadorInstallation`,
like the `baseImage`, the `logLevel` or any of the `helmValues`.

For example:

```yaml
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -n ambassador -f -
apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2
kind: AmbassadorInstallation
metadata:
  name: ambassador
spec:
  version: 1.2.0
EOF
```

After applying an `AmbassadorInstallation` customer resource like this in a new cluster, the Operator will install a new instance of Ambassador 1.2.0 in the `ambassador` namespace, immediately. Removing this `AmbassadorInstallation` will uninstall Ambassador from this namespace.

## Verify Configuration

**To verify that everything was installed and configured correctly,** you can visually confirm the set up in the Edge Policy Console on the “Debugging” tab. Alternatively, you can check the Operator pod in your cluster to check its health and run status.
