# Edgectl Install: DNS Failed to Propagate to This Host

The installer has acquired a DNS name for your Kubernetes cluster but is unable to resolve that name on your host.

## What's next?

If this appears to be an intermittent failure, try running the installer again:

```shell
edgectl install
```

Don't worry: it is safe to run the installer repeatedly on a cluster.

If running the installer again does not work, please reach out to us on [Slack](http://d6e.co/slack).
