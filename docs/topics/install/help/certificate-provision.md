# Edgectl Install: Failed to Acquire TLS Certificate
 
The installer was unable to acquire a TLS certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

## What's next?

This is an unusual, unexpected failure. Sorry about that!

Please run the installer again:

```shell
edgectl install
```

Don't worry: it is safe to run the installer repeatedly on a Kubernetes cluster.

If running the installer again does not work, please reach out to us on [Slack](http://d6e.co/slack).
