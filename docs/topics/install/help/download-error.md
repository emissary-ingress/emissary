# Edgectl Install: Can't reach the Internet

The installer retrieves the latests package to install AES over the Internet. If Internet connectivity is not available, the installer cannot proceed.

## What's next?

1. Restore Internet connectivity. Perhaps there is a VPN or firewall preventing access to the Internet.
2. Run the installer again:
```shell
   edgectl install
   ```

Don't worry: it is safe to run the installer repeatedly on a cluster.
