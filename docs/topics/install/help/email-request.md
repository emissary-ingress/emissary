# Edgectl Install: Error Requesting Your Email Address
 
When you run `edgectl install` to install the Ambassador Edge Stack, the system requests your email address. This email address is used to notify you before your TLS certificate and domain name expire. In order to acquire the TLS certificate, we share this email with Letâ€™s Encrypt.

For some reason this request failed. 

## What's next?

Please run the installer again and enter a valid email address.

```shell
edgectl install
```
