# Edgectl Install: Error Requesting Your Email Address
 
In order to acquire a TLS certificate for you from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and to provide you with an edgestack.me domain name, both Letâ€™s Encrypt and edgestack.me require an email address to be able to contact you about your TLS certificate and domain name expiration.

For some reason this request failed. 

## What's next?

Please run the installer again and enter a valid email address for the installer to send to Let's Encrypt.

```shell
edgectl install
```
