# Edgectl Install: Installer Failed to Create Host Resource

The installer was unable to create a new Host resource in your Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl apply` with the Host manifest.

## What's next?

If this appears to be an intermittent failure, try running the installer again:

```shell
edgectl install
```

Don't worry: it is safe to run the installer repeatedly on a Kubernetes cluster.

If running the installer again does not work, please reach out to us on [Slack](http://d6e.co/slack).
