# Edgectl Install: Failed to Log In to AES

The installer attempted to open the Ambassador Edge Stack (AES) Policy Console for you, but was unable to connect to the AES service in your Kubernetes cluster.

## What's next?

Run the installer again:

```shell
edgectl install
```

Don't worry: it is safe to run the installer repeatedly on a Kubernetes cluster.

If running the installer again does not work, please reach out to us on [Slack](http://d6e.co/slack).
