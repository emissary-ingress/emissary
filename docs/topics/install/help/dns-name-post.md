# Edgectl Install: Couldn't access the EdgeStack.me service

The installer could not access the EdgeStack.me service to acquire a DNS name for your Kubernetes cluster's load balancer.

## What's next?

This is likely an intermittant failure of the service. Please try again later. Simply run the installer again:

```shell
edgectl install
```

Don't worry: it is safe to run the installer repeatedly on a cluster.

If this failure persists, please get in touch on [Slack](http://d6e.co/slack).
