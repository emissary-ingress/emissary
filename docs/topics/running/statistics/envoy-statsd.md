# Envoy statistics with StatsD

> For an overview of other options for gathering statistics on
> Ambassador, see the [Statistics and Monitoring](../) overview.

At the core of Ambassador is [Envoy Proxy][], which has built-in
support for exporting a multitude of statistics about its own
operations to StatsD (or to the modified DogStatsD used by Datadog).

[Envoy Proxy]: https://www.envoyproxy.io

If enabled, then Ambassador has Envoy expose this information via the
ubiquitous and well-tested [StatsD](https://github.com/etsy/statsd)
protocol.  To enable this, you will simply need to set the environment
variable `STATSD_ENABLED=true` in Ambassador's deployment YAML:

```diff
     spec:
       containers:
       - env:
+        - name: STATSD_ENABLED
+          value: "true"
         - name: AMBASSADOR_NAMESPACE
           valueFrom:
             fieldRef:
```

When this variable is set, Ambassador by default sends statistics to a
Kubernetes service named `statsd-sink` on UDP port 8125 (the usual
port of the StatsD protocol).  You may instead tell Ambassador to send
the statistics to a different StatsD server by setting the
`STATSD_HOST` environment variable.  This can be useful if you have an
existing StatsD sink available in your cluster.

We have included a few example configurations in the
[`statsd-sink/`][] directory to help you get started.  Clone the
repository to get local, editable copies.

[`statsd-sink/`]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/tree/$branch$/deployments/statsd-sink

## Using Graphite as the StatsD sink

[Graphite][] is a web-based real-time graphing system.  Spin up an
example Graphite setup:

[Graphite]: http://graphite.readthedocs.org/

```shell
kubectl apply -f statsd-sink/graphite/graphite-statsd-sink.yaml
```

This sets up the `statsd-sink` service and a deployment that contains
Graphite and its related infrastructure.  Graphite's web interface is
available at `http://statsd-sink/` from within the cluster.  Use port
forwarding to access the interface from your local machine:

```shell
SINKPOD=$(kubectl get pod -l service=statsd-sink -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
kubectl port-forward $SINKPOD 8080:80
```

This sets up Graphite access at `http://localhost:8080/`.

## Using Prometheus StatsD Exporter as the StatsD sink

> Ambassador has an endpoint that has exposes statistics in a format
> that Prometheus understands natively.  If you're using Prometheus,

[the `:8877/metrics` endpoint]: ../8877-metrics)

[Prometheus][] is an open-source monitoring and alerting system.
Prometheus does not natively understand the StatsD protocol, but you
can deploy the [Prometheus StatsD Exporter][] to act as the StatsD
sink, and it will translate from StatsD to the [exposition format][]
that Prometheus requires.  An example of how deploying Prometheus
StatsD Exporter is available in [`prom-statsd-sink.yaml`][].

[Prometheus]: https://prometheus.io/
[Prometheus StatsD Exporter]: https://github.com/prometheus/statsd_exporter
[exposition format]: https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/
[`prom-statsd-sink.yaml`]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/blob/$branch$/deployments/statsd-sink/prometheus/prom-statsd-sink.yaml

To finally get the statistics to Prometheus, you then configure a
Prometheus target to read from `statsd-sink` on port 9102.

You could instead add the `statsd-sink` service and Prometheus StatsD
Exporter as a sidecar on the Ambassador pod.  If you do this, make
sure to set `STATSD_HOST=localhost` so that UDP packets are routed to
the sidecar.

### Configuring how Prometheus StatsD Exporter translates from StatsD to the Prometheus format

It may be desirable to change how metrics produced by the
`statsd-sink` are named, labeled and grouped when they finally make it
to Prometheus.

For example, by default, each service that Ambassador serves will
create a new metric using its name.  For the service called `usersvc`
you will see this metric
`envoy.cluster.usersvc_cluster.upstream_rq_total`.  This may lead to
problems if you are trying to create a single aggregate that is the
sum of all similar metrics from different services.  In this case, it
is common to differentiate the metrics for an individual service with
a `label`.  This can be done by configuring a Prometheus StatsD
Exporter "mapping" (not to be confused with an [Ambassador
"Mapping"][mappings]).  See [Metric Mapping and Configuration][] in
the Prometheus StatsD Exporter documentation to learn how to modify
its mappings.

[mappings]: ../../../using/mappings
[Metric Mapping and Configuration]: https://github.com/prometheus/statsd_exporter/tree/v0.6.0#metric-mapping-and-configuration

#### Configuring Prometheus StatsD Exporter with Helm

If you deploy Prometheus using Helm the value that you should change
in order to add a mapping is `prometheusExporter.configuration`.  Set
it to something like this:

```yaml
  configuration: |
    ---
    mappings:
    - match: 'envoy.cluster.*.upstream_rq_total'
      name: "envoy_cluster_upstream_rq_total"
      timer_type: 'histogram'
      labels:
        cluster_name: "$1"
```

#### Configuring Prometheus StatsD Exporter with `kubectl`

In the [`ambassador-rbac-prometheus.yaml`][] example template there is
a `ConfigMap` that should be updated.  Add your mapping to the
`configuration` property.

[`ambassador-rbac-prometheus.yaml`]: ../../../../../yaml/ambassador/ambassador-rbac-prometheus.yaml

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: ambassador-config
data:
  exporterConfiguration: |
    ---
    mappings:
    - match: 'envoy.cluster.*.upstream_rq_total'
      name: "envoy_cluster_upstream_rq_total"
      timer_type: 'histogram'
      labels:
        cluster_name: "$1"
```

### Using the Prometheus Operator to configure Prometheus for use with the Prometheus StatsD Exporter

If you don't already have a Prometheus setup, the [Prometheus
Operator][] is a powerful way to create and deploy Prometheus
instances.  Use the following YAML to quickly configure the Prometheus
Operator with Ambassador:

- [`statsd-sink.yaml`][] Creates the Prometheus Stats Exporter
  deployment and `statsd-sink` service that receives the statistics
  from Ambassador and translates them to Prometheus metrics.  It also
  creates a `ServiceMonitor` resource that tells the Prometheus
  Operator to configure Prometheus to fetch those metrics from the
  StatsD Exporter.
- [`prometheus.yaml`][] Deploys the Prometheus Operator and creates
  `Prometheus` resource that tells the Prometheus Operator to create
  the actual Prometheus deployment.

[Prometheus operator]: https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator
[`statsd-sink.yaml`]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/blob/$branch$/deployments/statsd-sink/prometheus/statsd-sink.yaml
[`prometheus.yaml`]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/blob/$branch$/deployments/statsd-sink/prometheus/prometheus.yaml

Make sure that the `ServiceMonitor` is in the same namespace as
Ambassador.  A walk-through of the basics of configuring the
Prometheus Operator with Ambassador is available
[here](http://www.datawire.io/faster/ambassador-prometheus/).

Ensure `STATSD_ENABLED` is set to `"true"` and apply the YAML with
`kubectl`:

```shell
kubectl apply -f statsd-sink.yaml
kubectl apply -f prometheus.yaml
```

Wait for a minute after the pods spin up and then access the
Prometheus dashboard by port-forwarding the Prometheus pod and going
to `http://localhost:9090/` on a web-browser.

```shell
kubectl port-forward prometheus-prometheus-0 9090
```

### Using Grafana to visualize statistics gathered by Prometheus

If you're using Grafana, [Alex Gervais][] has written a template
[Ambassador dashboard for Grafana][] that works with either the
metrics exposed by the Prometheus StatsD Exporter, or by [the
`:8877/metrics` endpoint][].

## Using Datadog DogStatsD as the StatsD sink

If you are a user of the [Datadog][] monitoring system, pulling in the
Envoy statistics from Ambassador is very easy.

[Datadog]: https://www.datadoghq.com/

Because the DogStatsD protocol is slightly different than the normal
StatsD protocol, in addition to setting Ambassador's
`STATSD_ENABLED=true` environment variable, you also need to set the
`DOGSTATSD=true` environment variable:

```diff
     spec:
       containers:
       - env:
+        - name: STATSD_ENABLED
+          value: "true"
+        - name: DOGSTATSD
+          value: "true"
         - name: AMBASSADOR_NAMESPACE
           valueFrom:
             fieldRef:
```

Then, you will need to deploy the DogStatsD agent in to your cluster
to act as the StatsD sink.  To do this, replace the sample API key in
our [sample YAML file][`dd-statsd-sink.yaml`] with your own, then
apply that YAML:

[`dd-statsd-sink.yaml`]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/blob/$branch$/deployments/statsd-sink/datadog/dd-statsd-sink.yaml

```shell
kubectl apply -f statsd-sink/datadog/dd-statsd-sink.yaml
```

This sets up the `statsd-sink` service and a deployment of the
DogStatsD agent that forwards the Ambassador statistics to your
Datadog account.
