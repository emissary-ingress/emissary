# Prefix Regex

## Using `prefix` and `prefix_regex`

When the `prefix_regex` attribute is set to `true`, Ambassador Edge Stack configures a [regex route](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.5.0/api-v1/route_config/route#route) instead of a prefix route in Envoy. **This means the entire path must match the regex specified, not only the prefix.**

## Example with a version in the URL

If the version is a path parameter and the resources are served by different services, then

```yaml
---
apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2
kind:  Mapping
metadata:
  name:  qotm
spec:
  prefix: "/(v1|v2)/qotm/.*"
  prefix_regex: true
  service: qotm
```

will map requests to both `/v1` and `/v2` to the `qotm` service.

Note that enclosing regular expressions in quotes can be important to prevent backslashes from being doubled.
