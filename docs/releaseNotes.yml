      - title: fix regression in the agent for the metrics transfer.
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          A regression was introduced in 2.3.0 causing the agent to miss some of the metrics coming from
          emissary ingress before sending them to Ambassador cloud. This issue has been resolved to ensure
          that all the nodes composing the emissary ingress cluster are reporting properly.

      - title: fix regression in tracing service config
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          A regression was introduced in 2.3.0 that leaked zipkin default config fields into the configuration
          for the other drivers (lightstep, etc...). This caused $productName$ to crash on startup. This issue has been resolved
          to ensure that the defaults are only applied when driver is <code>zipkin</code>

            link: https://github.com/emissary-ingress/emissary/issues/1743
      - title: Added support for the LogService v3 transport protocol
        type: feature
        body: >-
          Previously, a <code>LogService</code> would always have $productName$ communicate with the
          external log service using the <code>envoy.service.accesslog.v2.AccessLogService</code>
          API. It is now possible for the <code>LogService</code> to specify
          <code>protocol_version: v3</code> to use the newer
          <code>envoy.service.accesslog.v3.AccessLogService</code> API instead.  This functionality
          is not available if you set the <code>AMBASSADOR_ENVOY_API_VERSION=V2</code> environment
          variable.
      - title: CORS now happens before auth
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          When CORS is specified (either in a <code>Mapping</code> or in the <code>Ambassador</code>
          <code>Module</code>), CORS processing will happen before authentication. This corrects a
          problem where XHR to authenticated endpoints would fail.
      - title: Correctly handle caching of Mappings with the same name in different namespaces
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          In 2.x releases of $productName$ when there are multiple <code>Mapping</code>s that have the same
          <code>metadata.name</code> across multiple namespaces, their old config would not properly be removed
          from the cache when their config was updated. This resulted in an inability to update configuration
          for groups of <code>Mapping</code>s that share the same name until the $productName$ pods restarted.
      - title: Fix support for Zipkin API-v1 with Envoy xDS-v3
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          It is now possible for a <code>TracingService</code> to specify
          <code>collector_endpoint_version: HTTP_JSON_V1</code> when using xDS v3 to configure Envoy
          (which has been the default since $productName$ 1.14.0).  The <code>HTTP_JSON_V1</code>
          value configures Envoy to speak to Zipkin using Zipkin's old API-v1, while the
          <code>HTTP_JSON</code> value configures Envoy to speak to Zipkin using Zipkin's new
          API-v2. In previous versions of $productName$ it was only possible to use
          <code>HTTP_JSON_V1</code> when explicitly setting the
          <code>AMBASSADOR_ENVOY_API_VERSION=V2</code> environment variable to force use of xDS v2
          to configure Envoy.

  - version: 2.2.2

    notes:
      - title: TLS Secret validation is now opt-in
        type: change
        body: >-
          You may now choose to enable TLS Secret validation by setting the
          <code>AMBASSADOR_FORCE_SECRET_VALIDATION=true</code> environment variable. The default configuration does not
          enforce secret validation.

      - title: Correctly validate EC (Elliptic Curve) Private Keys
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          Kubernetes Secrets that should contain an EC (Elliptic Curve) TLS Private Key are now properly validated.

          Support for the Envoy V2 API is deprecated as of $productName$ v2.1, and will be removed in $productName$
          v3.0. The <code>AMBASSADOR_ENVOY_API_VERSION</code> environment variable will be removed at the same
          time. Only the Envoy V3 API will be supported (this has been the default since $productName$ v1.14.0).

      - title: Correctly support canceling rollouts

          $productName$ will now watch for ConfigMap or Secret resources specified by the
          <code>AGENT_CONFIG_RESOURCE_NAME</code> environment variable in order to allow all
          components (and not only the Ambassador Agent) to authenticate requests to
          Ambassador Cloud.

      - title: Update Alpine and libraries
        type: security
        body: >-
          $productName$ has updated Alpine to 3.15, and Python and Go dependencies
          to their latest compatible versions, to incorporate numerous security patches.

      - title: Support a log-level metric
        type: feature
        body: >-
          $productName$ now supports the metric <code>ambassador_log_level{label="debug"}</code>
          which will be set to 1 if debug logging is enabled for the running Emissary
          instance, or to 0 if not. This can help to be sure that a running production
          instance was not actually left doing debugging logging, for example.

        body: >-
          $productName$ is now leveraging a new Envoy Proxy patch that allows Envoy to accept escaped
          '%' characters in its configuration. This means that error_response_overrides and other
          custom user content can now contain '%' symbols escaped as '%%'.

      - title: Support received commands to pause, continue and abort a Rollout via Agent directives
        type: feature
        body: >-
          The Ambassador agent now receives commands to manipulate Rollouts (pause, continue, and
          abort are currently supported) via directives and executes them in the cluster. A report
          is sent to Ambassador Cloud including the command ID, whether it ran successfully, and
          an error message in case there was any.

      - title: Validate certificates in TLS Secrets
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          Kubernetes Secrets that should contain TLS certificates are now validated before being
          accepted for configuration. A Secret that contains an invalid TLS certificate will be logged
          as an invalid resource.

        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          Emissary-ingress 2.1.0 generated invalid Envoy configuration for
          <code>getambassador.io/v2</code> <code>Mappings</code> that set
          <code>spec.cors.origins</code> to a string rather than a list of strings; this has been
          fixed, and these <code>Mappings</code> should once again function correctly.

      - title: Correctly handle canary Mapping weights when reconfiguring
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          Changes to the <code>weight</code> of <code>Mapping</code> in a canary group
          will now always be correctly managed during reconfiguration; such changes could
          have been missed in earlier releases.

        body: >-
          A <code>Mapping</code> that is not part of a canary group, but that has a
          <code>weight</code> less than 100, will be correctly configured to receive all
          traffic as if the <code>weight</code> were 100.

          <code>Mapping</code>s with DNS wildcard <code>hostname</code> will now be correctly
          matched with <code>Host</code>s. Previously, the case where both the <code>Host</code>
          and the <code>Mapping</code> use DNS wildcards for their hostnames could sometimes

      - title: Fix overriding global settings for adding or removing headers
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          If the <code>ambassador</code> <code>Module</code> sets a global default for
          <code>add_request_headers</code>, <code>add_response_headers</code>,
          <code>remove_request_headers</code>, or <code>remove_response_headers</code>, it is often
          desirable to be able to turn off that setting locally for a specific <code>Mapping</code>.
          For several releases this has not been possible for <code>Mappings</code> that are native
          Kubernetes resources (as opposed to annotations), as an empty value ("mask the global
          default") was erroneously considered to be equivalent to unset ("inherit the global
          default").  This is now fixed.

          When using Kubernetes Secrets to store ACME private keys (as the Edge Stack
          ACME client does), an error would always be logged about the Secret not being
          present, even though it was present, and everything was working correctly.
