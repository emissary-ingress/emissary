    notes:
      - title: Docker BuildKit always used for builds
        type: change
        body: >-
          Docker BuildKit is enabled for all Emissary builds. Additionally, the Go
          build cache is fully enabled when building images, speeding up repeated builds.

      - title: CRD conversions
        type: feature
        body: >-
          It is now possible to use both the <code>getambassador.io/v2</code> and
          <code>getambassador.io/v3alpha1</code> apiVersions.  This is accomplished with the
          addition of an <code>emissary-ingress-apiext</code> Service and Deployment that handles
          converting between the two versions for the apiserver.  This allows the user to semlessly
          request and author resources in whichever API version is desired, and facilitates easier
          migration from Emissary 1.x to 2.x.  Resources authored in v3alpha1 will not be visible to
          Emissary 1.x; resources authored in v2 will be visible to both Emissary 1.x and 2.x.

      - title: Correctly handle all changing canary configurations
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          The incremental reconfiguration cache could miss some updates when multiple
          <code>Mapping</code>s had the same <code>prefix</code> ("canary"ing multiple
          <code>Mapping</code>s together). This has been corrected, so that all such
          updates correctly take effect.

      - title: Secrets used for ACME private keys will not log errors
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          When using Kubernetes Secrets to store ACME private keys (as the Edge Stack
          ACME client does), an error would always be logged about the Secret not being
          present, even though it was present, and everything was working correctly.
          This error is no longer logged.

      - title: When using gzip, upstreams will no longer receive encoded data
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          When using gzip compression, upstream services will no longer receive compressed
          data. This bug was introduced in 1.14.0. The fix restores the default behavior of
          not sending compressed data to upstream services.

        type: bugfix

      - title: Port configuration outside AmbassadorListener has been moved to AmbassadorListener
        body: The <code>TLSContext</code> <code>redirect_cleartext_from</code> and <code>AmbassadorHost</code> <code>requestPolicy.insecure.additionalPort</code> elements are no longer supported. Use a <code>AmbassadorListener</code> for this functionality instead.

This change can significantly improve $productName$'s memory footprint when many <code>AmbassadorHost</code>s are involved.

          Set <code>AMBASSADOR_AMBEX_NO_RATELIMIT</code> to <code>true</code> to completely disable
          ratelimiting Envoy reconfiguration under memory pressure. This can help performance with
          the endpoint or Consul resolvers, but could make OOMkills more likely with large
