        body: >-
          We're pleased to introduce $productName$ 2.0.4 for general availability for new 
          installations! The 2.X family introduces a number of changes to allow $productName$
          to more gracefully handle larger installations, reduce global configuration to better
          handle multitenant or multiorganizational installations, reduce memory footprint, and
          improve performance. We welcome feedback!! Join us on
          <a href="https://a8r.io/slack">Slack</a> and let us know what you think.

          The <code>x.getambassador.io/v3alpha1</code> API version has become the 
          <code>getambassador.io/v3alpha1</code> API version. The <code>Ambassador-</code>
          prefixes from <code>x.getambassador.io/v3alpha1</code> resources have been
          removed for ease of migration. <b>Note that <code>getambassador.io/v3alpha1</code>
          is the only supported API version for 2.0.4<b> &mdash; full support for
          <code>getambassador.io/v2</code> will arrive soon in a later 2.X version.

          $productName$ 2.0.0 introduces API version <code>x.getambassador.io/v3alpha1</code> for
          configuration changes that are not backwards compatible with the 1.X family.  API versions
          <code>getambassador.io/v0</code>, <code>getambassador.io/v1</code>, and
          <code>getambassador.io/v2</code> are deprecated.  Further details are available in the <a

      - title: The AmbassadorListener Resource
        body: The new <code>AmbassadorListener</code> CRD defines where and how to listen for requests from the network, and which <code>AmbassadorHost</code> definitions should be used to process those requests. Note that the <code>AmbassadorListener</code> CRD is <b>mandatory</b> and consolidates <i>all</i> port configuration; see the <a href="topics/running/ambassadorlistener"><code>AmbassadorListener</code> documentation</a> for more details.

      - title: AmbassadorMapping hostname DNS glob support
        body: >-
          Where <code>AmbassadorMapping</code>'s <code>host</code> field is either an exact match or (with <code>host_regex</code> set) a regex,
          the new <code>hostname</code> element is always a DNS glob. Use <code>hostname</code> instead of <code>host</code> for best results.

        type: feature

      - title: Memory usage improvements for installations with many AmbassadorHosts
        body: The behavior of the Ambassador module <code>prune_unreachable_routes</code> field is now automatic, which should reduce Envoy memory requirements for installations with many <code>AmbassadorHost</code>s

      - title: Correctly set Ingress resource status in all cases
        body: $productName$ 2.0.0 fixes a regression in detecting the Ambassador Kubernetes service that could cause the wrong IP or hostname to be used in Ingress statuses -- thanks, <a href="https://github.com/impl">Noah Fontes</a>!

        type: bugfix

        type: bugfix

      - title: Port configuration outside AmbassadorListener has been moved to AmbassadorListener
        body: The <code>TLSContext</code> <code>redirect_cleartext_from</code> and <code>AmbassadorHost</code> <code>requestPolicy.insecure.additionalPort</code> elements are no longer supported. Use a <code>AmbassadorListener</code> for this functionality instead.

        docs: about/changes-2.0.0/#tlscontext-redirect_cleartext_from-and-host-insecureadditionalport

      - title: PROXY protocol configuration has been moved to AmbassadorListener
        body: The <code>use_proxy_protocol</code> element of the Ambassador <code>Module</code> is no longer supported, as it is now part of the <code>AmbassadorListener</code> resource (and can be set per-<code>AmbassadorListener</code> rather than globally).
        type: change
        docs: about/changes-2.0.0/#proxy-protocol-configuration

      - title: Stricter rules for AmbassadorHost/AmbassadorMapping association
        body: An <code>AmbassadorMapping</code> will only be matched with an <code>AmbassadorHost</code> if the <code>AmbassadorMapping</code>'s <code>host</code> or the <code>AmbassadorHost</code>'s <code>selector</code> (or both) are explicitly set, and match. This change can significantly improve $productName$'s memory footprint when many <code>AmbassadorHost</code>s are involved.

      - title: Envoy V3 APIs
        body: By default, $productName$ will configure Envoy using the V3 Envoy API. This change is mostly transparent to users, but note that Envoy V3 does not support unsafe regular expressions or, e.g., Zipkin's V1 collector protocol. Further details are available in the <a href="about/changes-2.0.0">2.0.0 Changes</a> document.
