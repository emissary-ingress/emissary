      - title: AmbassadorMapping hostname DNS glob support
        body: >-
          Where <code>AmbassadorMapping</code>'s <code>host</code> field is either an exact match or (with <code>host_regex</code> set) a regex,
          the new <code>hostname</code> element is always a DNS glob. Use <code>hostname</code> instead of <code>host</code> for best results.

        type: feature

      - title: Memory usage improvements for installations with many AmbassadorHosts

      - title: Correctly set Ingress resource status in all cases
        body: $productName$ 2.0.0 fixes a regression in detecting the Ambassador Kubernetes service that could cause the wrong IP or hostname to be used in Ingress statuses -- thanks, <a href="https://github.com/impl">Noah Fontes</a>!
        docs: topics/running/ingress-controller
        type: bugfix

        type: bugfix

      - title: Port configuration outside AmbassadorListener has been moved to AmbassadorListener
        body: The <code>TLSContext</code> <code>redirect_cleartext_from</code> and <code>AmbassadorHost</code> <code>requestPolicy.insecure.additionalPort</code> elements are no longer supported. Use a <code>AmbassadorListener</code> for this functionality instead.

      - title: PROXY protocol configuration has been moved to AmbassadorListener

        type: change
        docs: about/changes-2.0.0/#proxy-protocol-configuration

      - title: Stricter rules for AmbassadorHost/AmbassadorMapping association
        body: An <code>AmbassadorMapping</code> will only be matched with an <code>AmbassadorHost</code> if the <code>AmbassadorMapping</code>'s <code>host</code> or the <code>AmbassadorHost</code>'s <code>selector</code> (or both) are explicitly set, and match. This change can significantly improve $productName$'s memory footprint when many <code>AmbassadorHost</code>s are involved. Further details are available in the <a href="about/changes-2.0.0/#host-and-mapping-association">2.0.0 Changes</a> document.

        type: change

      - title: AmbassadorHost or Ingress now required for TLS termination
        body: An <code>AmbassadorHost</code> or <code>Ingress</code> resource is now required when terminating TLS -- simply creating a <code>TLSContext</code> is not sufficient. Further details are available in the <a href="about/changes-2.0.0/#host-tlscontext-and-tls-termination"><code>AmbassadorHost</code> CRD documentation.</a>

      - title: Envoy V3 APIs
        body: By default, $productName$ will configure Envoy using the V3 Envoy API. This change is mostly transparent to users, but note that Envoy V3 does not support unsafe regular expressions or, e.g., Zipkin's V1 collector protocol. Further details are available in the <a href="about/changes-2.0.0">2.0.0 Changes</a> document.
        type: change
        docs: about/changes-2.0.0/#envoy-v3-api-by-default
