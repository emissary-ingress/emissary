        body: >-
          When using gzip compression, upstream services will no longer receive compressed
          data. This bug was introduced in 1.14.0. The fix restores the default behavior of
          not sending compressed data to upstream services.

      - title: New Envoy-configuration snapshots for debugging
        body: "Envoy-configuration snapshots get saved (as <code>ambex-#.json</code>) in <code>/ambassador/snapshots</code>. The number of snapshots is controlled by the <code>AMBASSADOR_AMBEX_SNAPSHOT_COUNT</code> environment variable; set it to 0 to disable. The default is 30."

          configurations. The default is <code>false</code>, meaning that the rate limiter is
          active.
