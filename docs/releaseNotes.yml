      - title: CORS now happens before auth
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          When CORS is specified (either in a <code>Mapping</code> or in the <code>Ambassador</code>
          <code>Module</code>), CORS processing will happen before authentication. This corrects a
          problem where XHR to authenticated endpoints would fail.

        type: change
        body: >-
          You may now choose to enable TLS Secret validation by setting the
          <code>AMBASSADOR_FORCE_SECRET_VALIDATION=true</code> environment variable. The default configuration does not
          enforce secret validation.

      - title: Correctly validate EC (Elliptic Curve) Private Keys

          Support for the Envoy V2 API is deprecated as of $productName$ v2.1, and will be removed in $productName$
          v3.0. The <code>AMBASSADOR_ENVOY_API_VERSION</code> environment variable will be removed at the same

          $productName$ will now watch for ConfigMap or Secret resources specified by the
          <code>AGENT_CONFIG_RESOURCE_NAME</code> environment variable in order to allow all
          components (and not only the Ambassador Agent) to authenticate requests to
          Ambassador Cloud.

      - title: Update Alpine and libraries
        type: security
        body: >-
          $productName$ has updated Alpine to 3.15, and Python and Go dependencies
          to their latest compatible versions, to incorporate numerous security patches.

      - title: Support a log-level metric
        type: feature
        body: >-
          $productName$ now supports the metric <code>ambassador_log_level{label="debug"}</code>
          which will be set to 1 if debug logging is enabled for the running Emissary
          instance, or to 0 if not. This can help to be sure that a running production
          instance was not actually left doing debugging logging, for example.

        body: >-
          $productName$ is now leveraging a new Envoy Proxy patch that allows Envoy to accept escaped

      - title: Support received commands to pause, continue and abort a Rollout via Agent directives
        type: feature
        body: >-
          The Ambassador agent now receives commands to manipulate Rollouts (pause, continue, and
          abort are currently supported) via directives and executes them in the cluster. A report
          is sent to Ambassador Cloud including the command ID, whether it ran successfully, and
          an error message in case there was any.

      - title: Validate certificates in TLS Secrets
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          Kubernetes Secrets that should contain TLS certificates are now validated before being
          accepted for configuration. A Secret that contains an invalid TLS certificate will be logged
          as an invalid resource.

          You can now set <code>preserve_servers</code> in Ambassador Edge Stack's
          <code>DevPortal</code> resource to configure the DevPortal to use server definitions from
          the OpenAPI document when displaying connection information for services in the DevPortal.

      - title: Docker BuildKit always used for builds
        type: change

          Docker BuildKit is enabled for all Emissary builds. Additionally, the Go
          build cache is fully enabled when building images, speeding up repeated builds.

      - title: Fix support for for v2 Mappings with CORS
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          Emissary-ingress 2.1.0 generated invalid Envoy configuration for
          <code>getambassador.io/v2</code> <code>Mappings</code> that set
          <code>spec.cors.origins</code> to a string rather than a list of strings; this has been
          fixed, and these <code>Mappings</code> should once again function correctly.
        docs: topics/using/cors/#the-cors-attribute
        image: ./v2.1.2-mapping-cors.png

      - title: Correctly handle canary Mapping weights when reconfiguring
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          Changes to the <code>weight</code> of <code>Mapping</code> in a canary group
          will now always be correctly managed during reconfiguration; such changes could
          have been missed in earlier releases.
        docs: topics/using/canary/#the-weight-attribute

      - title: Correctly handle solitary Mappings with explicit weights
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          A <code>Mapping</code> that is not part of a canary group, but that has a
          <code>weight</code> less than 100, will be correctly configured to receive all
          traffic as if the <code>weight</code> were 100.

      - title: Correctly handle empty rewrite in a Mapping
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          Using <code>rewrite: ""</code> in a <code>Mapping</code> is correctly handled
          to mean "do not rewrite the path at all".

      - title: Correctly use Mappings with host redirects
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          Any <code>Mapping</code> that uses the <code>host_redirect</code> field is now properly discovered and used. Thanks
          to <a href="https://github.com/gferon">Gabriel Féron</a> for contributing this bugfix!

        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          <code>Mapping</code>s with DNS wildcard <code>hostname</code> will now be correctly
          matched with <code>Host</code>s. Previously, the case where both the <code>Host</code>
          and the <code>Mapping</code> use DNS wildcards for their hostnames could sometimes
          not correctly match when they should have.

      - title: Fix overriding global settings for adding or removing headers
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          If the <code>ambassador</code> <code>Module</code> sets a global default for
          <code>add_request_headers</code>, <code>add_response_headers</code>,
          <code>remove_request_headers</code>, or <code>remove_response_headers</code>, it is often
          desirable to be able to turn off that setting locally for a specific <code>Mapping</code>.
          For several releases this has not been possible for <code>Mappings</code> that are native
          Kubernetes resources (as opposed to annotations), as an empty value ("mask the global
          default") was erroneously considered to be equivalent to unset ("inherit the global
          default").  This is now fixed.
        docs: topics/using/defaults/

      - title: Fix empty error_response_override bodies
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          It is now possible to set a <code>Mapping</code>
          <code>spec.error_response_overrides</code> <code>body.text_format</code> to an empty
          string or <code>body.json_format</code> to an empty dict.  Previously, this was possible
          for annotations but not for native Kubernetes resources.
        docs: topics/running/custom-error-responses/

      - title: Annotation conversion and validation
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          Resources that exist as <code>getambassador.io/config</code> annotations rather than as
          native Kubernetes resources are now validated and internally converted to v3alpha1 and,
          the same as native Kubernetes resources.

      - title: Validation error reporting
        type: bugfix

          some situations a validation error would not be reported.

          <code>Mapping</code>s had the same <code>prefix</code> ("canary"ing multiple
          <code>Mapping</code>s together). This has been corrected, so that all such

        body: >-
          When using Kubernetes Secrets to store ACME private keys (as the Edge Stack
          ACME client does), an error would always be logged about the Secret not being
          present, even though it was present, and everything was working correctly.

          We're pleased to introduce $productName$ 2.0.4 for general availability! The
          2.X family introduces a number of changes to allow $productName$ to more
          gracefully handle larger installations, reduce global configuration to better
          handle multitenant or multiorganizational installations, reduce memory footprint, and
          improve performance. We welcome feedback!! Join us on
