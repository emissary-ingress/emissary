# Datawire build-aux Introduction

build-aux is a collection of Makefile `.mk` snippets (and associated
utilities).  Each of the `.mk` snippets is written to be as
independent from the others as possible, but integrate well by
following common conventions.  You may pick-and-choose which to
include simply by writing `include build-aux/NAME.mk` in your
`Makefile`.

Each `.mk` snippet starts with a reference header-comment
identifying:

 - any inputs (mostly variables)
 - any outputs (targets, variables)
 - which targets from other snippets it hooks in to (mostly hooking
   in to `common.mk` targets)

You don't need to worry about dependencies between `.mk` files; each
file will automatically `include` the others it depends on.  You don't
need to worry about including a file twice; this is safe, as they all
have C-header-style include guards.

## `common.mk`

Most (but not all) of the snippets include `common.mk`, which

 1. Configures Make to use sane settings (since the default settings
    are set for historical compatibility, not the "right thing").

 2. Defines several `$(call â€¦)`-able helper functions, like
    `joinlist`, `path.trimprefix`, or `quote.shell`.  See
    [`common.mk`](../common.mk) itself for the full list, and
    documentation on how to use them.

 3. Declares several utility variables:
    - `GOOS`, `GOARCH`: Operating system name, and CPU architecture.
      `GO` is included in the variable names to indicate that they use
      the same names as `go env` (as opposed to using `uname
      -s`/`uname -m` names, or something else).  Most of the time,
      these are the host OS or architecture.  But, when inside of
      recipes for files in `bin_OS_ARCH/` directories, they are set to
      that OS and architecture.
    - `NL`: a single newline character, since that's hard to type in Make
    - `SPACE`: a single space character, since that's hard to type in
      Make

 4. Declares several high-level common targets, like `make build`,
    `make clean`, or `make check`.  See [`common.mk`](../common.mk)
    itself for the full list.  By defining a list of common
    user-facing targets, the rest of the snippets can hook in to that
    and provide a uniform interface.  With the exception of `make
    check` (which is special, see below), your `Makefile` can extend
    any of these by adding dependencies to the target name.  For
    example, to have `make build` build the `foo` file, you could
    write:

		build: foo

    or to have `make lint` run the `flake8` Python linter, you could
    write

		lint: flake8
		flake8:
			flake8 mypackage/
		.PHONY: flake8

    or

		lint:
			flake8 mypackage/

    The former has the advantage that it allows you to add multiple
	hooks on to `lint` (so it's the only method that build-aux
	snippets use), and also allows flake8 to run in parallel with
	other linters set up by build-aux snippets.

    `make check` is special in how it works.  Instead of writing

		check: my-test                  # WRONG

    you write

		test-suite.tap: my-test.tap     # CORRECT

    See [`testing.md`](./testing.md) for information about writing the
    recipe for `my-test.tap`.

    Because of the special semantics around `$(GOOS)` and `$(GOARCH)`
    in `bin_OS_ARCH/` directories, `common.mk` goes ahead and has
    `make clean` run `rm -rf -- bin_*`.  Because of `make check`'s use
    of `test-suite.tap`, `common.mk` also goes head and has `make
    clean` run `rm -f test-suite.tap`.

    With the exceptions of `make check` and `make clean`, `common.mk`
    only provides empty definitions; it is up to your `Makefile`, or
    other `.mk` snippets to make these rules actually do something.

## `help.mk`

The snippet `help.mk` adds a `make help` target, that display
information about your project (customizable by setting the
`help.body` variable from your `Makefile`), and a table of all of the
`make FOO` targets that Make knows about.  Any targets you write in
your `Makefile` that you think should be visible can be added to this
listing by writing a magic comment:

	frob: ## Frobnicate the splorks

See [`help.mk`](../help.mk) itself for full documentation.
