# edgectl install: Timed Out Waiting for the Load Balancer to Respond
 
## The Problem

The installer timed out while waiting for the load balancer to return its IP address for the AES Service. 

## How to Resolve It

You might try running the installer again.

If your cluster doesn't support load balancers, you'll need to expose AES in some other way.
