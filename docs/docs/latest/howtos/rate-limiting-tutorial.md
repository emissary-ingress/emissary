# Rate Limiting

The Ambassador Edge Stack can validate incoming requests before routing them to a backing service. In this tutorial, we'll configure the Ambassador Edge Stack to use a simple third party rate limit service. If you don't want to implement your own rate limiting service, the Ambassador Edge Stack integrates a [powerful, flexible rate limiting service](../../topics/using/rate-limits/).

## Before You Get Started

This tutorial assumes you have already followed the Ambassador Edge Stack [Getting Started](../../tutorials/getting-started) guide. If you haven't done that already, you should do that now.

Once completed, you'll have a Kubernetes cluster running Ambassador and the Quote of the Moment service. Let's walk through adding rate limiting to this setup.

## 1. Deploy the Rate Limit Service

The Ambassador Edge Stack delegates the actual rate limit logic to a third party service. We've written a [simple rate limit service](https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/tree/master/docker/test-ratelimit) that:

- listens for requests on port 5000;
- handles gRPC `shouldRateLimit` requests;
- allows requests with the `x-ambassador-test-allow: "true"` header; and
- marks all other requests as `OVER_LIMIT`;

Here's the YAML we'll start with:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2
kind: RateLimitService
metadata:
  name: ratelimit
spec:
  service: "example-rate-limit:5000"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: example-rate-limit
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: example-rate-limit
  ports:
  - port: 5000
    name: http-example-rate-limit
    targetPort: http-api
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: example-rate-limit
spec:
  replicas: 1
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example-rate-limit
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: example-rate-limit
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: example-rate-limit
        image: agervais/ambassador-ratelimit-service:1.0.0
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        ports:
        - name: http-api
          containerPort: 5000
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "0.1"
            memory: 100Mi
```

This configuration tells the Ambassador Edge Stack about the rate limit service, notably that it is serving requests at `example-rate-limit:5000`.

The Ambassador Edge Stack will see the RateLimitService and reconfigure itself within a few seconds. Note that the v2 API is available for the Ambassador Edge Stack.

## 2. Configure Ambassador Edge Stack Mappings

The Ambassador Edge Stack only validates requests on Mappings which set rate limiting descriptors. If Ambassador cannot contact the rate limit service, it will allow the request to be processed as if there were no rate limit service configuration.

### v0 API

Ambassador 0.50.0 and later requires the `v2` API Version for rate limiting. The `v2` API uses the `labels` attribute to attach rate limiting descriptors. Review the [Rate Limits configuration documentation](../../topics/using/rate-limits/) for more information.

Replace the label that is applied to the `service-backend` with:

```yaml
labels:
  ambassador:
    - request_label_group:
      - x-ambassador-test-allow:
          header: "x-ambassador-test-allow"
          omit_if_not_present: true
```

so the Mapping definition will now look like this:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2
kind: Mapping
metadata:
  name: service-backend
spec:
  prefix: /backend/
  service: quote
  labels:
    ambassador:    
      - request_label_group:      
        - x-ambassador-test-allow:        
          header: "x-ambassador-test-allow"
          omit_if_not_present: true
```

### v2 API

Ambassador versions 0.40.2 and earlier use the `v2` API version which uses the `rate_limits` attribute to set rate limiting descriptors.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: quote
  annotations:
    getambassador.io/config: |
      ---
      apiVersion: ambassador/v2
      kind: Mapping
      name: quote-backend
      prefix: /
      service: quote:5000
      ---
      apiVersion: ambassador/v2
      kind: Mapping
      name: quote-backend
      prefix: /backend/
      service: quote
      rate_limits:
        - descriptor: A test case
          headers:
            - "x-ambassador-test-allow"
spec:
  ports:
  - name: ui
    port: 5000
    targetPort: 5000
  - name: backend
    port: 8080
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: backend
```

This configuration tells the Ambassador Edge Stack about the rate limit rules to apply, notably that it needs the `x-ambassador-test-allow` header, and that it should set "A test case" as the `generic_key` descriptor when performing the gRPC request.

Note that both `descriptor` and `headers` are optional. However, if `headers` are defined, **they must be part of the request in order to be rate limited**.

Ambassador Edge Stack would also perform multiple requests to `example-rate-limit:5000` if we had defined multiple `rate_limits` rules on the mapping.

## 3. Test Rate Limiting

If we `curl` to a rate-limited URL:

```shell
$ curl -Lv -H "x-ambassador-test-allow: probably" $AMBASSADORURL/backend/
```

We get a 429, since we are limited.

```shell
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
content-length: 0
```

If we set the correct header value to the service request, we will get a quote successfully:

```shell
$ curl -Lv -H "x-ambassador-test-allow: true" $AMBASSADORURL/backend/

```
