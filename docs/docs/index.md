# Ambassador Edge Stack Documentation

The Ambassador Edge Stack is a comprehensive, self-service edge stack and API Gateway for Kubernetes built on [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/). The shift to Kubernetes and microservices has profound consequences for the capabilities you need at the edge, as well as how you manage the edge. The Ambassador Edge Stack has been engineered with this world in mind.

  * [Running Ambassador](latest/topics/running) is for operators, site reliability engineers, and other Ambassador users who are responsible for running Ambassador in production.
* [HOWTO Guides](latest/howtos) are recipes for configuring Ambassador to address specific challenges such as Single Sign-On, rate limiting, or integrating with a service mesh. They assume some general knowledge of Ambassador.
