# Guides

Guides are hands-on tutorials to walk you through configuring Ambassador for specific functionality. There are three main sections of the Guides:

* Build: For developers who are building applications with Ambassador and Kubernetes, featuring tutorials such as [gRPC](/user-guide/grpc) and [WebSockets](/user-guide/websockets-ambassador).
* Secure: For operators and developers who need to secure Ambassador, this section covers core security configuration such as [TLS configuration](/user-guide/tls-termination), [rate limiting](/user-guide/advanced-rate-limiting), and [using cert-manager](/user-guide/cert-manager).
* Release: Ambassador helps developers to quickly and safely ship updates, and troubleshoot issues. This section covers integration with service meshes such as [Istio](/user-guide/istio) and [distributed tracing](/user-guide/tracing-tutorial).

If you're interested in contributing to Ambassador, writing (or updating) a Guide is a great place to start. Join our [Slack channel](https://d6e.co/slack) and join #ambassador-dev to get started.
