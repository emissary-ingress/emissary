# Ambassador Edge Stack Docs

The Ambassador Edge Stack is a comprehensive, self-service edge stack and API Gateway for Kubernetes built on [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/). The shift to Kubernetes and microservices has profound consequences for the capabilities you need at the edge, as well as how you manage the edge. The Ambassador Edge Stack has been engineered with this world in mind.

## How the Documentation is Organized

We work hard at keeping our documentation useful for all of our users. Here's an overview:

* [Installation](/install) covers the different ways to install and upgrade Ambassador, including Helm, Docker, and manual YAML install.
* [Running and Using Ambassador](/topics) introduce key concepts of Ambassador. This section is broken into three main areas:
  * [Core Concepts](/topics/concepts) covers the core principles of Ambassador. Kubernetes and cloud-native development is different, and we explain how to use Ambassador in this context.
  * [Using Ambassador](/topics/using) is designed for app developers and other users of Ambassador.
  * [Running Ambassador](/topics/running) is for operators, site reliability engineers, and other Ambassador users who are responsible for running Ambassador in production.
* [HOWTO Guides](/howtos) are recipes for configuring Ambassador to address specific challenges such as Single Sign-On, rate limiting, or integrating with a service mesh. They assume some general knowledge of Ambassador.
