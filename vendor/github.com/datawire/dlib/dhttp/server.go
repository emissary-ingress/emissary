// Package dhttp is a simple production-ready HTTP server library for the 2020s.
//
// In his famous talk "Simplicity is Complicated"[1], Rob Pike talks about how even the most simple
// server using net/http.Server is already production-ready (and about how complicated it was for
// the Go designers to achieve that).  That was true in November 2015, when the talk was given.
// However, what "production-ready" means and what "simple" means have both changed since then.
//
// "Production-ready" has changed; it now includes HTTP/2 support; HTTP/2 had just been finalized a
// few months prior to the talk, and so wasn't something expected for production yet.  Some
// quite-good work has since gone in to net/http.Server to support HTTP/2 over TLS, but HTTP/2 over
// cleartext is forced to be left out because of backward-compatibility concerns; leaving the user
// to have to bolt it on themselves using golang.org/x/net/http2/h2c.  Cleartext users of
// net/http.Server must now choose between "production-ready" and "simplicity".  And even if the
// user does decide to sacrifice that simplicity, the solution cannot be called really be
// production-ready, since with x/net/http2/h2c alone cleartext HTTP/2 connections are not properly
// shut down when shutting down the server.
//
// "Simple" has changed; in August of the next year, the Go standard library gained "context", a
// unified mechanism for several things, most notably here for managing the lifecycle of processes.
// Simple now means using Contexts for the lifecycle.  In order to tack on Context support to
// net/http.Server, it gained a complex and confusing relationship between "Shutdown", "Close", and
// "BaseContext".  While net/http.Server has gained Context support, because of
// backward-compatibility concerns, it could not do it in a way that achieved simplicity.
//
// This package provides a simple production-ready HTTP server library, for the meaning that those
// words have going in to the 2020s.  To accomplish this, it makes breaking changes from
// net/http.Server, but keeps them to a minimum; it should still be familiar and comfortable to
// those who are already used to net/http.Server.  Fret not about throwing away all of the
// engineering that went in to net/http.Server; this package still uses net/http.Server internally.

// ServerConfig is a mostly-drop-in replacement for net/http.Server.
//
// This is better than http.Server because:
//
//  - It natively supports "h2c" (HTTP/2 over cleartext).
//
//  - Its "h2c" support is better than http.Server with golang.org/x/net/http2/h2c.NewHandler,
//    because it properly shuts down idle h2c connections when shutdown is initiated, rather than
//    allowing h2c connections to sit around forever.
//
//  - It uses Context cancellation as a simple and composable shutdown mechanism; supporting
//    dcontext hard/soft contexts, rather than awkward relationship between the Shutdown and Close
//    methods.
//
//    Rather than having to set up a tree of cleanup functions calling each other down through your
//    program and dealing with having to call .Shutdown() and .Close() from another goroutine (and
//    having to understand the relationship between .Shutdown() and .Close() and when to call each,
//    which is a bigger task than you might think), the "(ListenAnd)?Serve(TLS)?" methods simply
//    take a Context and perform cleanup when the Context becomes Done.  In order to differentiate
//    between whether you want it to hard-shutdown or graceful-shutdown, you may use the dcontext
//    hard/soft mechanism; if you don't use dcontext then it will be a hard-shutdown.
//
//  - When shutting down, it properly blocks when waiting for the workers of hijacked connections.
//
//    Hijacked connections are connections for which the .Handler said to the server "you know what,
//    stop doing HTTP and let me use the raw TCP socket" (as when having negotiated an upgrade from
//    HTTP/1 to WebSockets or from HTTP/1 to HTTP/2).  It is a design deficiency in net/http.Server
//    that the net/http.Server totally just stops tracking connections when they get hijacked;
//    failing to close them when you call net/http.Server.Close() and failing to wait for them when
//    you call net/http.Server.Shutdown(); and unfortunately that design deficiency is locked-in to
//    *http.Server because of backward compatibility promises.
//
//  - If you use dlog, you don't have to manually configure the logging for the server to do the
//    right thing.
//
// Breaking changes from http.Server to ServerConfig that will stop your old code from compiling:
//
//  - Obviously, the name is different.
//  - The "Addr" member field is removed; it is replaced by an "addr" argument to the
//    "ListenAndServe(TLS)?" methods.
//  - The "BaseContext" member field is removed; it is replaced by a "ctx" argument to the
//    "(ListenAnd)?Serve(TLS)?" methods.
//  - The "RegisterOnShutdown" is removed; it is replaced by an "OnShutdown" member field.
//  - The "SetKeepAlivesEnabled", "Shutdown", and "Close" methods are removed; they are conceptually
//    replaced by using Context cancellation for lifecycle management.  Use dcontext soft
//    cancellation for the graceful shutdown that "Shutdown" allowed.
//
// Breaking changes from http.Server to ServerConfig that will maybe make your old code incorrect:
//
//  - The semantics of the "TLSNextProto" member field are slightly different.
//  - The semantics of the "Error" member field are slightly different.
//  - The structure is deep-copied by each of the "(ListenAnd)?Serve(TLS)?" methods; mutating the
//    config structure while a server is running will not affect the running server.
//  - HTTP/2 support (both "h2" and "h2c") is built-in, so if your code configures HTTP/2 manually,
//    you're going to need to set "DisableHTTP2: true" to stop ServerConfig from stomping over your
//    code's work.
//
// Arguably-breaking changes from http.Server that to ServerConfig that I'd say are bugfixes, but
// could conceivably[2] make someone's old code incorrect:
//
//  - *http.Server.ServeTLS won't close the Listener if .ServeTLS returns early during setup due to
//    having been passed invalid cert or key files; ServerConfig.ServeTLS will always close the
//    Listener before returning; matching the "Serve" method.
//
// The reason for creating a new type and having breaking changes (rather than writing a few utility
// functions that take an *http.Server as an argument) is that it became increasingly clear that the
// lifecycle of a running server is tied to the lifecycle of the *http.Server object, while we've
// grown a standard "Context" lifecycle system that wants to tie the lifecycle to the function call,
// rather than to the object.  This divorce between lifecycles is embodied in the name of the type;
// when the lifecycle was tied to the object the type was named *http.Server.  Now the lifecycle is
// divorced from that, and the object is just configuration, so the type is named *ServerConfig.
