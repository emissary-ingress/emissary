/**
 * === HACK HACK HACK ===
 *
 * The existence of Host_nojson.proto is because if we bring in all the
 * k8s.io types that we would want to, the generated *.pb.json.go files try
 * to import github.com/gogo/protobuf/jsonpb, and that turns out to crash on
 * some of the k8s.io types. Sigh.
 *
 * So, instead, we split out the minimal high-level stuff we need in most of
 * of the Go code into Host_nojson.proto, and leave the more detailed things
 * with the breaking types here. For more information on this brutality, see
 * https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/pull/1999#issuecomment-548939518.
 *
 * === end hack ===
 *
 * Host defines a way that an Ambassador will be visible to the
 * outside world. A minimal Host defines a hostname (of course) by
 * which the Ambassador will be reachable, but a Host can also
 * tell an Ambassador how to manage TLS, and which resources to 
 * examine for further configuration.
