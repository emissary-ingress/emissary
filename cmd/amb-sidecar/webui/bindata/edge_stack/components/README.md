# Web Dev Components #

This is a directory of web components for powering the web ui for datawire.
These are built using the web components standard that are built into browsers.
There is a small wrapper framework around this called:

[LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/)

We recommend going through their documentation at least a little bit to
understand what a web component might look like according to the framework.
Once you do that, we recommend looking at the "README.ui-dev-gotchas.md"
which contains some basic things to watch out for.
