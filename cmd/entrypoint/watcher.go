// watcher is _the_ thing that watches all the different kinds of Ambassador configuration
// events that we care about. This right here is pretty much the root of everything flowing
// into Ambassador from the outside world, so:
//
// ******** READ THE FOLLOWING COMMENT CAREFULLY! ********
//
// Since this is where _all_ the different kinds of these events (K8s, Consul, filesystem,
// whatever) are brought together and examined, and where we pass judgement on whether or
// not a given event is worth reconfiguring Ambassador or not, the interactions between
// this function and other pieces of the system can be quite a bit more complex than you
// might expect. There are two really huge things you should be bearing in mind if you
// need to work on this:
//
// 1. The set of things we're watching is not static, but it must converge.
//
//    An example: you can set up a Kubernetes watch that finds a KubernetesConsulResolver
//    resource, which will then prompt a new Consul watch to happen. At present, nothing
//    that that Consul watch could find is capable of prompting a new Kubernetes watch to
//    be created. This is important: it would be fairly easy to change things such that
//    there is a feedback loop where the set of things we watch does not converge on a
//    stable set. If such a loop exists, fixing it will probably require grokking this
//    watcher function, kates.Accumulator, and maybe the reconcilers in consul.go and
//    endpoints.go as well.
//
// 2. No one source of input events can be allowed to alter the event stream for another
//    source.
//
//    An example: at one point, a bug in the watcher function resulted in the Kubernetes
//    watcher being able to decide to short-circuit a watcher iteration -- which had the
//    effect of allowing the K8s watcher to cause _Consul_ events to be ignored. That's
//    not OK. To guard against this:
//
//    A. Refrain from adding state to the watcher loop.
//    B. Try very very hard to keep logic that applies to a single source within that
//       source's specific case in the watcher's select statement.
//    C. Don't add any more select statements, so that B. above is unambiguous.
//
// 3. If you add a new channel to watch, you MUST make sure it has a way to let the loop
//    know whether it saw real changes, so that the short-circuit logic works correctly.
//    That said, recognize that the way it works now, with the state for the individual
//    watchers in the watcher() function itself is a crock, and the path forward is to
//    refactor them into classes that can separate things more cleanly.
//
// 4. If you don't fully understand everything above, _do not touch this function without
//    guidance_.

	// Ambassador has three sources of inputs: kubernetes, consul, and the filesystem. The job of
	// the watcherLoop is to read updates from all three of these sources, assemble them into a
	// single coherent configuration, and pass them along to other parts of ambassador for
	// processing.

	// The watcherLoop must decide what information is relevant to solicit from each source. This is
	// decided a bit differently for each source.
	//
	// For kubernetes the set of subscriptions is basically hardcoded to the set of resources
	// defined in interesting_types.go, this is filtered down at boot based on RBAC limitations. The
	// filtered list is used to construct the queries that are passed into this function, and that
	// set of queries remains fixed for the lifetime of the loop, i.e. the lifetime of the
	// abmassador process (unless we are testing, in which case we may run the watcherLoop more than
	// once in a single process).
	//
	// For the consul source we derive the set of resources to watch based on the configuration in
	// kubernetes, i.e. we watch the services defined in Mappings that are configured to use a
	// consul resolver. We use the ConsulResolver that a given Mapping is configured with to find
	// the datacenter to query.
	//

	// its view of the world. It then determines if enough information has been assembled to
