# Kubernetes manifests (`./k8s-*/`)

Right now, there are several `./k8s-*/` directories that are a little
sprawling (https://github.com/datawire/apro/issues/82).  Inside of
each, the organization is something like:

* `01-*.yaml` - Set up the namespace
  - `01-namespace.yaml` - Set up the namespace
* `02-*.yaml` - Things that must happen *before* Ambassador starts
  - `02-consul.yaml` - Consul (needed to start before APro consul integration)
* `03-*.yaml` - Ambassador
  - `03-ambassador.yaml` - Ambassador OSS
  - `03-ambassador-pro-standalone.yaml` - Ambasador Pro
  - `03-ambassador-pro-sidecar.yaml` - Ambasador OSS+Pro
  - `03-consul-connect-integration.yaml`
* `04-*.yaml` - Example applications
  - `04-ambassador-certs.yaml` - TLS certificate for Ambassador
    (generated by Makefile)
  - `04-httpbin.yaml` - Service example that will seat behind the load
    balancer.
  - `04-httpbin-policy.yaml` - Tells which resources the
    Ambassador-Pro service should protect.
  - `04-tenants.yaml` - Tells which applications should Ambassador-Pro
    protects.
