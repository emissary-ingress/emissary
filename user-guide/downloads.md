# Downloads

You'll need to download `edgectl` to access the Ambassador Edge Stack interface. You can download the file directly from one of these links:

* MacOS: https://metriton.datawire.io/downloads/darwin/edgectl

* Linux: https://metriton.datawire.io/downloads/linux/edgectl

Once you've downloaded `edgectl`, make it executable (e.g., `chmod a+x edgectl`).
