# Change Log

This file documents all notable changes to Ambassador Helm Chart. The release
numbering uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org).

## v8.4.0 - 2022-01-03

- Upgrade Emissary to v3.4.0 [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/emissary-ingress/emissary/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

- The Ambassador agent that was previously embedded in Emissary Ingress has been moved to a standalone container.

## v8.3.0

- Upgrade Emissary to v3.3.0 [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/emissary-ingress/emissary/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

- Change: By default, the Ambassador agent will report diagnostics to the Ambassador Cloud

- Change: updated auto-scaling resource cpu and memory variable ordering to help with git-ops syncing. Also, adjusted memory and cpu settings to be more friendly so that they do not cause the HPA auto-scaling to trigger during start-up. Thanks to [Ian Martin](https://github.com/aztechian) for the contribution!

## v8.2.0

- Upgrade Emissary to v3.2.0 [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/emissary-ingress/emissary/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

- Bugfix: The default Role configuration of the Ambassador Agent Deployment will allow it to correctly watch Secret resources for Ambassador Cloud tokens.

## v8.1.0

- Upgrade Emissary to v3.1.0 [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/emissary-ingress/emissary/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

- Change: The default for the `module` value has changed to enable serving remote client requests to the <code>:8877/ambassador/v0/diag/</code> endpoint by default.

## v8.0.0

- Upgrade Emissary to v3.0.0 [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/emissary-ingress/emissary/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

- Change: The default for the `module` value has changed to disable
  the `/ambassador/v0/` â†’ `127.0.0.1:8877` synthetic Mapping by
  default. We have long recommended to turn this off for production
  use; it is now off by default.

- Bugfix: The default values no trigger the creation of an
  "emissary-test-ready" Pod. This Pod was meant to only be created
  when running the chart's test suite; it was not meant to be created
  in users' clusters.

## v6.0.0

Introduces Ambassador Edge Stack being installed by default.

### Breaking changes

Ambassador Pro support has been removed in 6.0.0. Please upgrade to the Ambassador Edge Stack.

## v5.0.0

### Breaking changes

**Note** If upgrading an existing helm 2 installation no action is needed, previously installed CRDs will not be modified.

- Helm 3 support for CRDs was added. Specifically, the CRD templates were moved to non-templated files in the `/crds` directory, and to keep Helm 2 support they are globbed from there by `/templates/crds.yaml`. However, because Helm 3 CRDs are not templated, the labels for new installations have necessarily changed

## v4.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- Introduces the performance tuned and certified build of open source Ambassador, Ambassador core
- The license key is now stored and read from a Kubernetes secret by default
- Added `.Values.pro.licenseKey.secret.enabled` `.Values.pro.licenseKey.secret.create` fields to allow multiple releases in the same namespace to use the same license key secret.

### Minor Changes

- Introduces the ability to configure resource limits for both Ambassador Pro and it's redis instance
- Introduces the ability to configure additional `AuthService` options (see [AuthService documentation](https://www.getambassador.io/reference/services/auth-service/))
- The ambassador-pro-auth `AuthService` and ambassador-pro-ratelimit `RateLimitService` and now created as CRDs when `.Values.crds.enabled: true`
- Fixed misnamed selector for redis instance that failed in an edge case
- Exposes annotations for redis deployment and service

## v3.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- The default annotation has been removed. The service port will be set dynamically to 8080 or 8443 for http and https respectively.
- `service.http`, `service.https`, and `additionalTCPPort` has been replaced with `service.ports`.
- `rbac.namespaced` has been removed. Use `scope.singleNamespace` instead.

### Minor Changes

- Ambassador Pro will pick up when `AMBASSADOR_ID` is set in `.Values.env` [[#15025]](https://github.com/helm/charts/issues/15025).
- `{{release name}}-admins` has been renamed to `{{release name}}-admin` to match YAML install templates
- RBAC configuration has been updated to allow for CRD use when `scope.singleNamespace: true`. [[ambassador/#1576]](https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/issues/1576)
- RBAC configuration now allows for multiple Ambassadors to use CRDs. Set `crds.enabled` in releases that expect CRDs [[ambassador/#1679]](https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/issues/1679)
