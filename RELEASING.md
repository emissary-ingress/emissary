Releasing Ambassador
====================

If you just want to **use** Ambassador, check out https://www.getambassador.io/! You don't need to build - much less release! - anything, and in fact you shouldn't.

If you don't work at Datawire, this document is probably not going to help you. Maybe check out [the developer guide](BUILDING.md) instead.

----

If you're still reading, you must be at Datawire. Congrats, you picked a fine place to work! To release Ambassador, you'll need credentials for our Github repos.

Note. PRs will pile up on `master`. **Don't accept PRs for which CI doesn't show passing tests.** 
When we get to the stage of creating a release, all the PRs that we want to merge will have been merged
and the CI will be green.

1. Once `master` has all the release drivers, tag `master` with an RC tag, e.g. `v0.77.0-rc.1`. **This version tag must start with a 'v'.** For example:
    git tag v0.77.0-rc.1 master
    git push --tags origin master

2. The RC tag will trigger CI to run a new build and new tests. It had better pass: if not, figure out why. Monitor https://travis-ci.com/datawire/amabassador/ until the CI for ambassador completes and is green.

3. The RC build will be available as e.g. `quay.io/datawire/ambassador:0.77.0-rc.1` and also as e.g. `quay.io/datawire/ambassador:0.77.0-rc-latest`. Any other testing you want to do against this image, rock on.

4. When you're happy that the RC is ready for GA, **first** assemble the list of changes that you'll put into CHANGELOG.md: (Note: place this list in a separate file, maybe `~/temp-list.txt`, but definitely not in CHANGELOG.md at this time.
   - We always call out things contributed by the community, including who committed it
     - you can mention the contributor with a link back to their GitHub page
   - We always call out features and major bugfixes
   - We always include links to GitHub issues where we can
   - We rarely include fixes to the tests, build infrastructure, etc.
   - Look at e.g. `git log v0.77.0..HEAD --no-merges --pretty '%h (%ai, %ae, %an): %s' -- ':(exclude)docs'`
     and at the list of closed PRs. This is an awkward area of the release process as there are a log commits
     and PRs but we only want to include a curated subset that makes sense to the users.

5. Once the change list is assembled, hand it to Marketing so they can either write a blog post or tell you it's not needed.

6. While the blog post is being written, switch to a new branch for the release.
   - `git checkout -b rel/0.84.0` (or whatever version). **Do not name this branch "release/...".**

7. Next, sync up docs.
   - `make pull-docs` to pull updates from the docs repo
   - Handle conflicts as needed.
   - Commit any conflict-resolution changes to your release branch.

8. After the docs are synced, use `make release-prep` to update `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/versions.yml`.
   - This will prompt you for the release notes, so retrieve them from your previous file (maybe `~/temp-list.txt`).
     The release notes are pasted in at a prompt (during the make), not read from a file, so you will need them
     accessible to select-and-copy (suggestion: open your previous file in another window).
   - It will _commit_, but not _push_, the updated files. Make sure the diffs it shows you look correct!
      - It is *critical* to update `docs/versions.yml` so that everyone gets the new version.
   - Do a manual `git push` on your branch.

9. Now for the time-critical bit.
   - Tag your branch with a GA tag like `v0.77.0` and let CI do its thing. **This version tag must start with a 'v'.**
   - CI will retag the latest RC image as the GA image.

10. _After the CI run finishes_:
   - Submit, and land, a PR for your branch.
   - `make push-docs` from `master` _after the retag_ to push new docs out to the website.
   - Go to https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/releases and create a new release.
      - `make release-prep` should've output the text to paste into the release description.

   **Note** that there must be at least one RC build before a GA, since the GA tag **does not** rebuild the docker images -- it retags the ones built by the RC build. This is intentional, to allow for testing to happen on the actual artifacts that will be released.

   **Note also** that even though the version _tag_ starts with a 'v', the version _number_ displayed by the diag UI will _not_ start with a 'v'.**

11. Submit a PR into the `helm/charts` repo to update things in `stable/ambassador`:
   - in `Chart.yaml`, update `appVersion` with the new Ambassador version, and bump `version`.
   - in `README.md`, update the default value of `image.tag`.
   - in `values.yaml`, update `tag`.
   - Helpful stuff for this:
      - git checkout master               # switch to master
      - git fetch --all --prune           # make sure our view of remotes is up to date
      - git pull                          # pull down any changes to master
      - git rebase upstream/master        # move master on top of upstream
      - git push                          # push rebases to our fork
      - git checkout -b update/$VERSION   # switch to a feature branch
      - make your edits
      - git commit -a                     # commit changes -- don't forget DCO in the message!
      - git push origin update/$VERSION   # push to feature branch
      - open a PR
    - Once your PR is merged, _delete the feature branch without merging it back to origin/master_.

12. Update the getambassador.io website by submitting a PR to the `datawire/getambassador.io` repo.
   - `src/releaseInfo.js` is the only file you should need to touch:
      - `ReleaseType` comes from Marketing, usually "Feature Release", "Maintenance Release", or "Security Update"
      - `CurrentVersion` is e.g. "0.78.0" -- no leading 'v' here
      - `BlogLink` is the full URL of the blog post (from Marketing), or "" if there is no blog post
   - Make your edits, submit a PR, get it merged. Done.
      - If you want to test before submitting, use `npm install && npm start` and point a web browser to `localhost:8000`

   Submit a PR to the Ambassador website repository to update the version on the homepage.

### Host a release branch on getambassador.io

getambassador.io can host multiple versions of ambassador documentation. As a matter of policy, only the documentation for major and minor releases is hosted, documentation changes for patch releases are expected to be folded in the associated minor release.

#### Introduction

Whenever a new release is cut in ambassador, a release branch is created for that release. Generally these release branches are named as `release/v<release version>`.
A major and a minor release branch is expected to be long lived, protected and it contains the documentation for that particular branch under `/docs/` directory.

To host these different versions of documentation on the website, the following machinery is set up.

In getambassador.io.git repository:

- The release branches are exposed via git submodules under /submodules/ directory.
```
submodules/
├── 1.1 <--- links to `release/v1.1` branch
├── 1.2 <--- links to `release/v1.2` branch
├── 1.3 <--- links to `release/v1.3` branch
└── latest <--- links to `release/v1.3` branch
```
- All markdown files under `/docs-structure/` directory make their way to the getambassador.io website with the _exact_ path as they are in.
```
docs-structure/
├── docs <--- This is where we want to expose the /docs/ directory from our release branches
├── edgestack.me
├── kat
├── libraries.md
├── README.md
└── yaml -> ../submodules/latest/docs/yaml/
```
- Now that we have all release branches under `/submodules/`, we further link their `/docs/` directories under `/docs-structure/docs/`.
```
docs-structure/docs/
├── 1.1 -> ../../submodules/1.1/docs
├── 1.2 -> ../../submodules/1.2/docs
├── 1.3 -> ../../submodules/1.3/docs
└── latest -> ../../submodules/latest/docs
```

This is how our docs are laid out.

In ambassador.git, the CI is configured to update the submodules in getambassador.io.git on every documentation update to the release branches, which deploys to the website.

#### How to host a new release branch.

After a new major/minor release is cut, this is how to host it on the website.
For example, let's suppose version 1.4 of ambassador needs to be hosted.

##### In ambassador.git,

- In the branch `release/v1.4`,
  - In `docs/js/doc-links.yml`, make sure the links are pointed at `/docs/latest/...`
  - In `docs/js/doc-page.js`, update the footer branch.
  ```
  <DocFooter page={page} branch="release/v1.4" />
  ```
  - Update `.travis.yml` to push on every doc change to `release/v1.4` branch.
  ```yaml
  deploy:
  # Add this section
  - provider: script
    script: ./.ci/publish-website
    skip_cleanup: true
    on:
      branch: release/v1.4
  - provider: script
    script: ./.ci/publish-website
    skip_cleanup: true
    on:
      branch: release/v1.3
  - provider: script
    script: ./.ci/publish-website
    skip_cleanup: true
    on:
      branch: release/v1.2
  ```

##### In getambassador.io.git,
- Add the submodule pointing to `release/v1.4` branch to the `submodules/1.4/` directory
```
git submodule add --name ambassador-1.4 --branch release/v1.4 https://github.com/datawire/ambassador.git submodules/1.4/
```
- Update `ambassador-latest` submodule to point to `release/v1.4` branch.
```
$ cat .gitmodules
[submodule "ambassador-latest"]
        path = submodules/latest
        url = https://github.com/datawire/ambassador.git
        branch = release/v1.4
...
...
...
```
- Now link only the docs in this branch under `/docs-structure/docs/` directory.
```
cd docs-structure/docs/
ln -s ../../submodules/1.4/docs 1.4
```
- Add 1.4 dropdown link in `src/components/Header/Header.js` file.
```js
              <li>
                <div className={classnames(styles.Dropdown, !isDocLink((location || {}).pathname) && styles.hidden)}>
                  <button className={classnames(styles.DropdownButton, styles.DocsDropdownColor)}>{ docsVersion((location || {}).pathname) } ▾</button>
                  <div className={styles.DropdownContent}>
                    <Link to="/docs/latest/">Latest</Link>
                    <Link to="/docs/1.4/">1.4</Link>
                    <Link to="/docs/1.3/">1.3</Link>
                    <Link to="/docs/1.2/">1.2</Link>
                    <Link to="/docs/1.1/">1.1</Link>
                  </div>
                </div>
              </li>
```

##### Note:
Now the website must now display v1.4 docs under getambassador.io/docs/. Make sure everything looks right.

##### In ambassador.git,

Now that the latest release is `1.4`, we need to remove that tag from `1.3`.

- In the branch `release/v1.3`,
  - In `docs/js/doc-links.yml`, change all link prefixes to `/docs/1.3` from `/docs/latest`

##### Note:
You should be all set now.
- `/docs/latest/` must now show v1.4 docs.
- `/docs/1.4/` must now point to `/docs/latest/`.
- `/docs/1.3/` must now show docs under `release/v1.3` branch.
- The rest of the versions must also show the right set of docs.
