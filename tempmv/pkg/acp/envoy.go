//
// package acp contains stuff dealing with the Ambassador Control Plane as a whole.
//
// This is the EnvoyWatcher, which is a class that can keep an eye on a running
// Envoy - and just Envoy, all other Ambassador elements are ignored - and tell you
// whether it's alive and ready, or not.
//
// At the moment, "alive" and "ready" mean the same thing for an EnvoyWatcher. Both
// IsAlive() and IsReady() methods exist, though, for a future in which we monitor
// them separately.
//
// TESTING HOOKS:
// Since we try to check Envoy readiness to see how Envoy is doing, you can use
// EnvoyWatcher.SetReadyCheck to change the function that EnvoyWatcher uses to
// check readiness. The default is EnvoyWatcher.defaultFetcher, which tries to pull
// readiness from http://localhost:8001/ready.
//
// This hook is NOT meant for you to change the fetcher on the fly in a running
// EnvoyWatcher. Set it at instantiation, then leave it alone. See envoy_test.go
// for more.
