// package acp contains stuff dealing with the Ambassador Control Plane as a whole.
//
// This is the AmbassadorWatcher, which is a class that can keep an eye on a running
// Ambassador as a whole, and tell you whether it's alive and ready, or not.
//
// THE STATE MACHINE AND THE GRACE PERIOD:
// When an Ambassador pod boots, Envoy is _not_ started at boot time: instead, we
// wait for the initial configuration to be generated and only then start Envoy (this
// is because we don't know what port to tell Envoy to listen on until after we've
// generated the initial configuration). However, Envoy can't come up instantly,
// either.
//
// To deal with this, there's a state machine in here. We start in envoyNotStarted
// state, move to envoyStarting when the first snapshot is processed, then move to
// envoyRunning when we successfully get stats back from Envoy. These states inform
// what, exactly, we demand to declare Ambassador alive, dead, ready, or not ready.
//
// If you like pictures instead of words:   envoyNotStarted
//                                                |
//                                                | (first snapshot is processed)
//                                                V
//                                          envoyStarting
//                                                |
//                                                | (we got stats from Envoy)
//                                                V
//                                          envoyRunning
//
// Envoy is currently given 30 seconds to come up after getting its initial
// configuration. This may be the wrong compromise: in practice, Envoy should come
// up _much_ faster than that, but the idea this code is more about providing a
// conservative failsafe than providing a finely-tuned hair trigger.
//
// TESTING HOOKS:
// Since time plays a role, you can use AmbassadorWatcher.SetFetchTime to change the
// function that the AmbassadorWatcher uses to fetch times. The default is time.Now.
//
// This hook is NOT meant for you to change the values on the fly in a running
// AmbassadorWatcher. Set it at instantiation if need be, then leave it alone. See
// ambassador_test.go for more.
