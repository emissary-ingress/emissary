# NOTE: The IPAllow and IPDeny tests are not entirely straightforward. In
# particular:
# 
# 1. They currently use an annotation for their Ambassador modules to keep
#    them distinct between the two tests. If you don't like annotations for
#    this, you'll have to set up separate namespaces.
#
# 2. 'xff_num_trusted_hosts' MUST BE SET TO 1 in order for the tests to work:
# 
#    - When we hit /target/ with XFF "99.99.0.1", Envoy receives exactly that.
#      Since xff_num_trusted_hops is 1, Envoy accepts that as the valid address
#      of the remote end of the connection, RBAC accepts that as matching the
#      99.99.0.0/16 CIDR block, and the request is allowed or denied as
#      appropriate. Great. But when it's accepted, the rules for XFF are that
#      Envoy must append the peer address to the XFF list before forwarding, so
#      the upstream sees XFF "99.99.0.1,$katIP". In the /target/ case, the 
#      upstream is a KAT backend HTTP service -- it doesn't care about XFF, and
#      just responds OK.
#
#    - When we hit /localhost/ with XFF "99.99.0.1", though, _Ambassador is the
#      upstream_. So everything up to rewriting XFF as "99.99.0.1,$katIP" is the
#      same, but Envoy hands that upstream to... itself. Since xff_num_trusted_hops
#      is still 1, Envoy throws away the 99.99.0.1 part and believes that the 
#      connection is coming from $katIP, which does _not_ match the 99.99.0.0/16
#      CIDR block -- but the raw peer address _is_ in fact 127.0.0.1, so _that_
#      matches the peer: 127.0.0.1 principal.
