1 license-detection error:
 1. distrib "CacheControl" "1.99.6": Could not parse license-string "UNKNOWN"
    This probably means that you added or upgraded a dependency, and the
    automated opensource-license-checker can't confidently detect what
    the license is.  (This is a good thing, because it is reminding you
    to check the license of libraries before using them.)

    Some possible causes for this issue are:

    - Dependency is proprietary Ambassador Labs software: Create a yaml
    file with the proprietary dependencies and pass it to the
    generate.sh script using the --proprietary-packages command line
    option.  See the README.md file for more information.

    - License information can't be identified: Add an entry to
    hardcodedGoDependencies, hardcodedPythonDependencies or
    hardcodedJsDependencies depending on the dependency that was not
    identified.
