name: 'Dirty git Check'
description: |
  On Windows, `git status` doesn't record no-op
  line-ending changes in to the index, so things show as
  dirty even if they aren't.  Trying to `add` them does
  trigger the appropriate index update.  So do a `git add`
  *before* the `git status --porcelain` to work around
  Windows being terrible; we'd otherwise put the `git add`
  inside of the `if` block to help generate better output
  for `git diff`.
runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - name: "Dirty git Check"
      shell: bash
      run: |
        git add .
        if [[ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]]; then
           PAGER= git diff --cached
           exit 1
        fi
