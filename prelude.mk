# Functions

# Usage: $(call joinlist,SEPARATOR,LIST)
# Example: $(call joinlist,/,foo bar baz) => foo/bar/baz
joinlist=$(if $(word 2,$2),$(firstword $2)$1$(call joinlist,$1,$(wordlist 2,$(words $2),$2)),$2)

# Usage: $(call path.trimprefix,PREFIX,LIST)
# Example: $(call path.trimprefix,foo/bar,foo/bar foo/bar/baz) => . baz
path.trimprefix = $(patsubst $1/%,%,$(patsubst $1,$1/.,$2))

# Usage: $(call path.addprefix,PREFIX,LIST)
# Example: $(call path.addprefix,foo/bar,. baz) => foo/bar foo/bar/baz
path.addprefix = $(patsubst %/.,%,$(addprefix $1/,$2))

# Usage: $(call quote.shell,STRING)
# Example: $(call quote.shell,some'string"with`special characters) => "some'string\"with\`special characters"
#
# Based on
# https://git.lukeshu.com/autothing/tree/build-aux/Makefile.once.head/00-quote.mk?id=9384e763b00774603208b3d44977ed0e6762a09a
# but modified to make newlines work with shells other than Bash.
quote.shell = "$$(printf '%s\n' $(subst $(NL),' ','$(subst ','\'',$1)'))"

# Usage: VAR = $(call lazyonce,VAR,EXPR)
#
# Caches the value of EXPR (in case it's expensive/slow) once it is
# evaluated, but doesn't eager-evaluate it either.
lazyonce = $(eval $(strip $1) := $2)$($(strip $1))

# Targets

# Sometimes we have a file-target that we want Make to always try to
# re-generate (such as compiling a Go program; we would like to let
# `go install` decide whether it is up-to-date or not, rather than
# trying to teach Make how to do that).  We could mark it as .PHONY,
# but that tells Make that "this isn't a "this isn't a real file that
# I expect to ever exist", which has a several implications for Make,
# most of which we don't want.  Instead, we can have them *depend* on
# a .PHONY target (which we'll name "FORCE"), so that they are always
# considered out-of-date by Make, but without being .PHONY themselves.
.PHONY: FORCE
