We welcome contributions from the community. Here are some guidelines.

# Coding style

* Ratelimit uses golang's `fmt` too.

# Submitting a PR

* Fork the repo and create your PR.
* Tests will automatically run for you.
* When all of the tests are passing, tag @lyft/network-team and we will review it and
  merge once our CLA has been signed (see below).
* Party time.

# CLA

* We require a CLA for code contributions, so before we can accept a pull request we need
  to have a signed CLA. Please visit our [CLA service](https://oss.lyft.com/cla) and follow
  the instructions to sign the CLA.
