## Development Setup

This section provides the steps for getting started developing on Emissary-ingress. There are a number of prerequisites that need to be setup. In general, our tooling tries to detect any missing requirements and provide a friendly error message. If you ever find that this is not the case please file an issue.

> **Note:** To enable developers contributing on Macs with Apple Silicon, we ensure that the artifacts are built for `linux/amd64`
> rather than the host `linux/arm64` architecture. This can be overriden using the `BUILD_ARCH` environment variable. Pull Request are welcome :).

### Step 1: Install Build Dependencies

Here is a list of tools that are used by the build system to generate the build artifacts, packaging them up into containers, generating  crds, helm charts and for running tests.

- git
- make
- docker (make sure you can run docker commands as your dev user without sudo)
- bash
- rsync
- golang - `go.mod` for current version
- python 3.8 or 3.9
- kubectl
- a kubernetes cluster (you need permissions to create resources, i.e. crds, deployments, services, etc...)
- a Docker registry
- bsdtar (Provided by libarchive-tools on Ubuntu 19.10 and newer)
- gawk

### Step 2: Clone Project

If you haven't already then this would be a good time to clone the project running the following commands:

```bash
# clone to your preferred folder
git clone https://github.com/emissary-ingress/emissary.git

# navigate to project
cd emissary
```

### Step 3: Configuration

You can configure the build system using environment variables, two required variables are used for setting the container registry and the kubeconfig used.

> **Important**: the test and build system perform destructive operations against your cluster. Therefore, we recommend that you
> use a development cluster. Setting the DEV_KUBECONFIG variable described below ensures you don't accidently perform actions on a production cluster.

Open a terminal in the location where you cloned the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
# set container registry using `export DEV_REGISTRY=<your-registry>
# note: you need to be logged in and have permissions to push
# Example:
export DEV_REGISTRY=docker.io/parsec86

# set kube config file using `export DEV_KUBECONFIG=<dev-kubeconfig>`
# your cluster needs the ability to read from the configured container registry
export DEV_KUBECONFIG="$HOME/.kube/dev-config.yaml"

```

### Step 4: Building

The build system for this project leverages `make` and multi-stage `docker` builds to produce the following containers:

- `emissary.local/emissary` - single deployable container for Emissary-ingress
- `emissary.local/kat-client` - test client container used for testing
- `emissary.local/kat-server` - test server container used for testing

Using the terminal session you opened in step 2, run the following commands

>

```bash
# This will pull and build the necessary docker containers and produce multiple containers.
# If this is the first time running this command it will take a little bit while the base images are built up and cached.
make images

# verify containers were successfully created, you should also see some of the intermediate builder containers as well
docker images | grep emissary.local
```

*What just happened?*

The build system generated a build container that pulled in envoy, the build dependencies, built various binaries from within this project and packaged them into a single deployable container. More information on this can be found in the [Architecture Document](ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Step 5: Push

Now that you have successfully built the containers its time to push them to your container registry which you setup in step 2.

In the same terminal session you can run the following command:

```bash
# re-tags the images and pushes them to your configured container registry
# docker must be able to login to your registry and you have to have push permissions
make push

# you can view the newly tag images by running 
docker images | grep <your -registry>

# alternatively, we have two make targets that provide information as well
make env

# or in a bash export friendly format
make export
```

### Step 6: Deploy

Now its time to deploy the container out to your Kubernetes cluster that was configured in step 2. Hopefully, it is already becoming apparent that we love to leverage Make to handle the complexity for you :).

```bash
# generate helm charts and K8's Configs with your container swapped in and apply them to your cluster
make deploy

# check your cluster to see if emissary is running
# note: kubectl doesn't know about  DEV_KUBECONFIG so you may need to ensure KUBECONFIG is pointing to the correct cluster
kubectl get pod -n ambassador
```

ðŸ¥³ If all has gone well then you should have your development environment setup for building and testing Emissary-ingress.

### What's Next?

Now that you have your dev system up and running here are some additional content that we recommend you check out:

## Contributing a Pull Request

Before contributing be sure to read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Governance](GOVERNANCE.md) to get an understanding of how our project is structured.

1. **Identify an  Issue**
   - Start by creating or searching for an open issue (*it is good to check open PR's too*)
   - We will assign an issue to you so that others know who is working on it

2. **Cut a development branch from `master`**.
   - We recommend that your branches start with your username.
      - At Ambassador Labs we typically use `git-flow`-style naming, e.g. `flynn/dev/telepathic-ui`
   - Please do not use a branch name starting with `release`.

3. If your development takes any significant time, **merge master back into your branch regularly**.
   - Think "every morning" and "right before submitting a pull request."
   - If you're using a branch name that starts with your username, `git rebase` is also OK and no one from Ambassador Labs will scream at you for force-pushing.
   - Please do **not** rebase any branch that does **not** start with your username.

   ```bash
   # make sure you local master branch has the latest
   git checkout master
   git pull -ff origin master

   # rebase development branch on master
   # fix any conflicts if they occur during rebase
   git checkout <your-dev-branch>
   git rebase master

   # if you previously pushed your changes to Github then your rebase will require you to force push
   git push origin <your-dev-branch> -f 
   ```

4. **Code changes must have associated documentation updates.**
   - Make changes in <https://github.com/datawire/ambassador-docs> as necessary,
   and include a reference to those changes the pull request for your code
   changes.
   - See [Contributing to Docs](#contributing-to-the-docs) for more details.

5. **Code changes must include passing tests.**
   - See `python/tests/README.md` for more here.
   - Your tests **must** actually test the change you're making.
   - Your tests **must** pass in order for your change to be accepted.

6. **Commit** should summarize what was changed
   - we **require** that all commits are signed off so please be sure to commit using the `--signoff` flag, e.g. `git commit --signoff`
   - commit message should summarize the fix and motivation for the proposed fix. Include issue # that the fix looks to address.

7. When you have things working and tested, **submit a pull request back to `master`**.
   - Make sure your branch is up-to-date with `master` right before submitting the PR, see previos steps on how to `rebase`
   - The PR will trigger CI to perform a build and run tests.
   - CI tests **must** be passing for the PR to be merged.

8. One of the [Maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md) will review your PR and discuss any changes that need to be made

9. When all is well, maintainers will merge the PR into `master`, accepting your
   change for the next Emissary-ingress release. Thanks!

## Contributing to the Docs

The Emissary-ingress community will all benefit from having documentation that is useful and correct. If you have found an issue with the end user documentation, then please help us out by submitting an issue and/or pull request with a fix!

The end user documentation for Emissary-ingress lives in a different repository and can be found at <https://github.com/datawire/ambassador-docs>.

See this repository for details on how to contribute to either a `pre-release` or already-released version of Emissary-ingress.

## Advanced Topics

This section is for more advanced topics that provide more detailed instructions. Make sure you go through the Development Setup and read the Architecture document before exploring these topics.

### Running Emissary-ingress internals locally

The main entrypoint is written in go. It strives to be as compatible as possible
with the normal go toolchain. You can run it with:

```bash
go run ./cmd/busyambassador entrypoint
```

Of course just because you can run it this way does not mean it will succeed.
The entrypoint needs to launch `diagd` and `envoy` in order to function, and it
also expect to be able to write to the `/ambassador` directory.

#### Setting up diagd

If you want to hack on diagd, its easiest to setup a virtualenv with an editable
copy and launch your `go run` from within that virtualenv. Note that these
instructions depend on the virtualenvwrapper
(<https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>) package:

```bash
# Create a virtualenv named venv with all the python requirements
# installed.
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
# If you're doing this in Datawire's apro.git, then:
cd ambassador
# Update pip and install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install orjson    # see below
pip install -r builder/requirements.txt
# Created an editable installation of ambassador:
pip install -e python/
# Check that we do indeed have diagd in our path.
which diagd
# If you're doing this in Datawire's apro.git, then:
cd ..
```

(Note: it shouldn't be necessary to install `orjson` by hand. The fact that it is
at the moment is an artifact of the way Ambassador builds currently happen.)

#### Changing the ambassador root

You should now be able to launch ambassador if you set the
`ambassador_root` environment variable to a writable location:

   ambassador_root=/tmp go run ./cmd/busyambassador entrypoint

#### Getting envoy

If you do not have envoy in your path already, the entrypoint will use
docker to run it. At the moment this is untested for macs which probably
means it is broken since localhost communication does not work by
default on macs. This can be made to work as soon an intrepid volunteer
with a mac reaches out to me (rhs@datawire.io).

#### Shutting up the pod labels error

An astute observe of the logs will notice that ambassador complains
vociferously that pod labels are not mounted in the ambassador
container. To reduce this noise, you can:

```bash
mkdir /tmp/ambassador-pod-info && touch /tmp/ambassador-pod-info/labels
```

#### Extra credit

When you run ambassador locally it will configure itself exactly as it
would in the cluster. That means with two caveats you can actually
interact with it and it will function normally:

1. You need to run `telepresence connect` or equivalent so it can
   connect to the backend services in its configuration.

2. You need to supply the host header when you talk to it.

### Debugging and Developing Envoy Configuration

Envoy configuration is generated by the ambassador compiler. Debugging
the ambassador compiler by running it in kubernetes is very slow since
we need to push both the code and any relevant kubernetes resources
into the cluster. The following sections will provide tips for improving
this development experience.

#### Mockery

Fortunately we have the `mockery` tool which lets us run the compiler
code directly on kubernetes resources without having to push that code
or the relevant kubernetes resources into the cluster. This is the
fastest way to hack on and debug the compiler.

The `mockery` tool runs inside the Docker container used to build
Ambassador, using `make shell`, so it's important to realize that it
won't have access to your entire filesystem. There are two easy ways
to arrange to get data in and out of the container:

1. If you `make sync`, everything in the Ambassador source tree gets rsync'd
   into the container's `/buildroot/ambassador`. The first time you start the
   shell, this can take a bit, but after that it's pretty fast. You'll
   probably need to use `docker cp` to get data out of the container, though.

2. You may be able to use Docker volume mounts by exporting `BUILDER_MOUNTS`
   with the appropriate `-v` switches before running `make shell` -- e.g.

    ```bash
    export BUILDER_MOUNTS=$(pwd)/xfer:/xfer
    make shell
    ```

   will cause the dev shell to mount `xfer` in your current directory as `/xfer`.
   This is known to work well on MacOS (though volume mounts are slow on Mac,
   so moving gigabytes of data around this way isn't ideal).

Once you've sorted out how to move data around:

1. Put together a set of Ambassador configuration CRDs in a file that's somewhere
   that you'll be able to get them into the builder container. The easy way to do
   this is to use the files you'd feed to `kubectl apply`; they should be actual
   Kubernetes objects with `metadata` and `spec` sections, etc. (If you want to
   use annotations, that's OK too, just put the whole `Service` object in there.)

2. Run `make compile shell` to build everything and start the dev shell.

3. From inside the build shell, run

   ```bash
   mockery $path_to_your_file
   ```

   If you're using a non-default `ambassador_id` you need to provide it in the
   environment:

   ```bash
   AMBASSADOR_ID=whatever mockery $path_to_your_file
   ```

   Finally, if you're trying to mimic `KAT`, copy the `/tmp/k8s-AmbassadorTest.yaml`
   file from a KAT run to use as input, then

   ```bash
   mockery --kat $kat_test_name $path_to_k8s_AmbassadorTest.yaml
   ```

   where `$kat_test_name` is the class name of a `KAT` test class, like `LuaTest` or
   `TLSContextTest`.

4. Once it's done, `/tmp/ambassador/snapshots` will have all the output from the
   compiler phase of Ambassador.

The point of `mockery` is that it mimics the configuration cycle of real Ambassador,
without relying at all on a Kubernetes cluster. This means that you can easily and
quickly take a Kubernetes input and look at the generated Envoy configuration without
any other infrastructure.

#### Ambassador Dump

The `ambassador dump` tool is also useful for debugging and hacking on
the compiler. After running `make shell`, you'll also be able to use
the `ambassador` CLI, which can export the most import data structures
that Ambassador works with as JSON.  It works from an input which can
be either a single file or a directory full of files in the following
formats:

- raw Ambassador resources like you'll find in the `demo/config` directory; or
- an annotated Kubernetes resources like you'll find in `/tmp/k8s-AmbassadorTest.yaml` after running `make test`; or
- a `watt` snapshot like you'll find in the `$AMBASSADOR_CONFIG_BASE_DIR/snapshots/snapshot.yaml` (which is a JSON file, I know, it's misnamed).

Given an input source, running

```bash
ambassador dump --ir --v2 [$input_flags] $input > test.json
```

will dump the Ambassador IR and v2 Envoy configuration into `test.json`. Here
`$input_flags` will be

- nothing for raw Ambassador resources;
- `--k8s` for Kubernetes resources; or
- `--watt` for a `watt` snapshot.

You can get more information with

```bash
ambassador dump --help
```

### Making changes to Envoy

Emissary-ingress is built on top of Envoy and leverages a vendored version of Envoy (*we track upstream very closely*). This section will go into how to make changes to the Envoy that is packaged with Emissary-ingress.

This is a bit more complex than anyone likes, but here goes:

#### 1. Preparing your machine

Building and testing Envoy can be very resource intensive.  A laptop
often can build Envoy... if you plug in an external hard drive, point
a fan at it, and leave it running overnight and most of the next day.
At Datawire, we'll often spin up a temporary build machine in GCE, so
that we can build it very quickly.

As of Envoy 1.15.0, we've measure the resource use to build and test
it as:

> | Command            | Disk Size | Disk Used | Duration[1] |
> |--------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
> | `make update-base` | 450G      |  12GB     | ~11m        |
> | `make check-envoy` | 450G      | 424GB     | ~45m        |
>
> [1] On a "Machine type: custom (32 vCPUs, 512 GB memory)" VM on GCE,
> with the following entry in its `/etc/fstab`:
>
> ```bash
> tmpfs:docker  /var/lib/docker  tmpfs  size=450G  0  0
> ```

If you have the RAM, we've seen huge speed gains from doing the builds
and tests on a RAM disk (see the `/etc/fstab` line above).

#### 2. Setting up your workspace to hack on Envoy

1. From your `ambassador.git` checkout, get Ambassador's current
   version of the Envoy sources, and create a branch from that:

   ```shell
   make $PWD/_cxx/envoy
   git -C _cxx/envoy checkout -b YOUR_BRANCHNAME
   ```

2. Tell the build system that, yes, you really would like to be
   compiling envoy, as you'll be modifying Envoy:

   ```shell
   export YES_I_AM_OK_WITH_COMPILING_ENVOY=true
   export ENVOY_COMMIT='-'
   ```

   Building Envoy is slow, and most Ambassador contributors do not
   want to rebuild Envoy, so we require the first two environment
   variables as a safety.

   Setting `ENVOY_COMMIT=-` does 3 things:
    1. Tell it to use whatever is currently checked out in
       `./_cxx/envoy/` (instead of checking out a specific commit), so
       that you are free to modify those sources.
    2. Don't try to download a cached build of Envoy from a Docker
       cache (since it wouldn't know which `ENVOY_COMMIT` do download
       the cached build for).
    3. Don't push the build of Envoy to a Docker cache (since you're
       still actively working on it).

#### 3. Hacking on Envoy

Modify the sources in `./_cxx/envoy/`.

#### 4. Building and testing your hacked-up Envoy

- **Build Envoy** with `make update-base`.  Again, this is *not* a
   quick process.  The build happens in a Docker container; you can
   set `DOCKER_HOST` to point to a powerful machine if you like.

- **Test Envoy** and run with Envoy's test suite (which we don't run
  during normal Ambassador development) by running `make check-envoy`.
  Be warned that Envoy's full **test suite** requires several hundred
  gigabytes of disk space to run.

  Inner dev-loop steps:

  - To run just specific tests, instead of the whole test suite, set
     the `ENVOY_TEST_LABEL` environment variable.  For example, to run
     just the unit tests in
     `test/common/network/listener_impl_test.cc`, you should run

     ```shell
     ENVOY_TEST_LABEL='//test/common/network:listener_impl_test' make check-envoy
     ```

  - You can run `make envoy-shell` to get a Bash shell in the Docker
     container that does the Envoy builds.

  Interpreting the test results:

  - If you see the following message, don't worry, it's harmless; the
     tests still ran:

     ```text
     There were tests whose specified size is too big. Use the --test_verbose_timeout_warnings command line option to see which ones these are.
     ```

     The message means that the test passed, but it passed too
     quickly, and Bazel is suggesting that you declare it as smaller.
     Something along the lines of "This test only took 2s, but you
     declared it as being in the 60s-300s ('moderate') bucket,
     consider declaring it as being in the 0s-60s ('short')
     bucket".

     Don't be confused (as I was) in to thinking that it was saying
     that the test was too big and was skipped and that you need to
     throw more hardware at it.

- **Build or test Ambassador** with the usual `make` commands, with
  the exception that you MUST run `make update-base` first whenever
  Envoy needs to be recompiled; it won't happen automatically.  So
  `make test` to build-and-test Ambassador would become `make
  update-base && make test`, and `make images` to just build
  Ambassador would become `make update-base && make images`.  By
  default (to keep the tests fast), the tests avoid running much
  traffic through Envoy, and instead just check that the Envoy
  configuration that Ambassador generates hasn't changed since the
  previous version (since we generally trust that Envoy works, and
  doesn't change as often).  Since you *are* changing Envoy, you'll
  need to run the tests with `KAT_RUN_MODE=envoy` set in the
  environment in order to actually test against Envoy.

#### 5. Finalizing your changes

Once you're happy with your changes to Envoy:

1. Ensure they're committed to `_cxx/envoy/` and push/PR them into
   <https://github.com/datawire/envoy> branch `rebase/master`.

   If you're outside of Datawire, you'll need to
    a. Create a fork of <https://github.com/datawire/envoy> on the
       GitHub web interface
    b. Add it as a remote to your `./_cxx/envoy/`:
       `git remote add my-fork git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/envoy.git`
    c. Push the branch to that fork:
       `git push my-fork YOUR_BRANCHNAME`

2. Update `ENVOY_COMMIT` in `_cxx/envoy.mk`

3. Unset `ENVOY_COMMIT=-` and run a final `make update-base` to
   push a cached build:

   ```shell
   export YES_I_AM_OK_WITH_COMPILING_ENVOY=true
   unset ENVOY_COMMIT
   make update-base
   ```

   The image will be pushed to `$ENVOY_DOCKER_REPO`, by default
   `ENVOY_DOCKER_REPO=docker.io/datawire/ambassador-base`; if you're
   outside of Datawire, you can skip this step if you don't want to
   share your Envoy binary anywhere. If you don't skip this step,
   you'll need to `export
   ENVOY_DOCKER_REPO=${your-envoy-docker-registry}` to tell it to push
   somewhere other than Datawire's registry.

   If you're at Datawire, you'll then want to make sure that the image
   is also pushed to the backup container registries:

   ```shell
   TAG=GET_THIS_FROM_THE_make_update-base_OUTPUT

   source_registry=docker.io/datawire
   docker pull "$source_registry/ambassador-base:$TAG"
   for target_registry in quay.io/datawire gcr.io/datawire; do
     docker tag "$source_registry/ambassador-base:$TAG" "$target_registry/ambassador-base:$TAG"
     docker push "$target_registry/ambassador-base:$TAG"
   done
   ```

   If you're outside of Datawire, you can skip this step if you
   don't want to share your Envoy binary anywhere.  If you don't
   skip this step, you'll need to `export
   ENVOY_DOCKER_REPO=${your-envoy-docker-registry}` to tell it to
   push somewhere other than Datawire's registry.

4. Push/PR the `envoy.mk` `ENVOY_COMMIT` change to
   <https://github.com/datawire/ambassador> (or
   <https://github.com/datawire/apro> if you're inside Datawire).

#### 6. Checklist for landing the changes

I'd put this in the pull request template, but so few PRs change Envoy...

### Developing Emissary-ingress (Datawire-only advice)

At the moment, these techniques will only work internally to Datawire. Mostly
this is because they require credentials to access internal resources at the
moment, though in several cases we're working to fix that.

#### Updating license documentation

When new dependencies are added or existing ones are updated, run
`make generate` and commit changes to `DEPENDENCIES.md` and
`DEPENDENCY_LICENSES.md`

#### Upgrading Python dependencies

Delete `python/requirements.txt`, then run `make generate`.

If there are some dependencies you don't want to upgrade, but want to
upgrade everything else, then

 1. Remove from `python/requirements.txt` all of the entries except
    for those you want to pin.
 2. Delete `python/requirements.in` (if it exists).
 3. Run `make generate`.

## FAQ

This section contains a set of Frequently Asked Questions that may answer a question you have. Also, feel free to ping us in Slack.

### How do I find out what build targets are available?

Use `make help` and `make targets` to see what build targets are
available along with documentation for what each target does.

### How do I develop on a Mac with Apple Silicon?

To ensure that developers using a Mac with Apple Silicon can contribute, the build system ensures
the build artifacts are `linux/amd64` rather than the host architecture. This behavior can be overriden
using the `BUILD_ARCH` environment variable (e.g. `BUILD_ARCH=linux/arm64 make images`).

### How do I develop on Windows using WSL?

As the Emissary-ingress build system requires docker communication via a UNIX socket, using WSL 1 is not possible.
Not even with a `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable set. As a result, you have to use WSL 2, including using the
WSL 2 version of docker-for-windows.

Additionally, if your hostname contains an upper-case character, the build script will break. This is based on the
`NAME` environment variable, which should contain your hostname. You can solve this issue by doing `export NAME=my-lowercase-host-name`.
If you do this *after* you've already run `make images` once, you will manually have to clean up the docker images
that have been created using your upper-case host name.

### How do I test using a private Docker repository?

If you are pushing your development images to a private Docker repo,
then:

```sh
export DEV_USE_IMAGEPULLSECRET=true
export DOCKER_BUILD_USERNAME=...
export DOCKER_BUILD_PASSWORD=...
```

and the test machinery should create an `imagePullSecret` from those Docker credentials such that it can pull the images.

### How do I change the loglevel at runtime?

```console
curl localhost:8877/ambassador/v0/diag/?loglevel=debug
```

Note: This affects diagd and Envoy, but NOT the AES `amb-sidecar`.
See the AES `DEVELOPING.md` for how to do that.

### Can I build from a docker container instead of on my local computer?

If you want to build within a container instead of setting up dependencies on your local machine then you can run the build within a docker container and leverage "Docker in Docker" to build it.

1. `docker pull docker:latest`
2. `docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -it docker:latest sh`
3. `apk add --update --no-cache bash build-base go curl rsync python3 python2 git libarchive-tools gawk jq`
4. `git clone https://github.com/emissary-ingress/emissary.git && cd emissary`
5. `make images`

Steps 0 and 1 are run on your machine, and 2 - 4 are from within the docker container. The base image is a "Docker in Docker" image, ran with `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` in order to connect to your local daemon from the docker inside the container. More info on Docker in Docker [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker).

The images will be created and tagged as defined above, and will be available in docker on your local machine.

### How do I clear everything out to make sure my build runs like it will in CI?

Use `make clobber` to completely remove all derived objects, all cached artifacts, everything, and get back to a clean slate. This is recommended if you change branches within a clone, or if you need to `make generate` when you're not *certain* that your last `make generate` was using the same Envoy version.

Use `make clean` to remove derived objects, but *not* clear the caches.

### My editor is changing `go.mod` or `go.sum`, should I commit that?

If you notice this happening, run `make go-mod-tidy`, and commit that.

(If you're in Ambassador Labs, you should do this from `apro/`, not
`apro/ambassador/`, so that apro.git's files are included too.)

### How do I debug "This should not happen in CI" errors?

These checks indicate that some output file changed in the middle of a
run, when it should only change if a source file has changed.  Since
CI isn't editing the source files, this shouldn't happen in CI!

This is problematic because it means that running the build multiple
times can give different results, and that the tests are probably not
testing the same image that would be released.

These checks will show you a patch showing how the output file
changed; it is up to you to figure out what is happening in the
build/test system that would cause that change in the middle of a run.
For the most part, this is pretty simple... except when the output
file is a Docker image; you just see that one image hash is different
than another image hash.

Fortunately, the failure showing the changed image hash is usually
immediately preceded by a `docker build`.  Earlier in the CI output,
you should find an identical `docker build` command from the first time it
ran.  In the second `docker build`'s output, each step should say
`---> Using cache`; the first few steps will say this, but at some
point later steps will stop saying this; find the first step that is
missing the `---> Using cache` line, and try to figure out what could
have changed between the two runs that would cause it to not use the
cache.

If that step is an `ADD` command that is adding a directory, the
problem is probably that you need to add something to `.dockerignore`.
To help figure out what you need to add, try adding a `RUN find
DIRECTORY -exec ls -ld -- {} +` step after the `ADD` step, so that you
can see what it added, and see what is different on that between the
first and second `docker build` commands.

### How do I run Emissary-ingress tests?

- `export DEV_REGISTRY=<your-dev-docker-registry>` (you need to be logged in and have permission to push)
- `export DEV_KUBECONFIG=<your-dev-kubeconfig>`

If you want to run the Go tests for `cmd/entrypoint`, you'll need `diagd`
in your `PATH`. See the instructions below about `Setting up diagd` to do
that.

| Group           | Command                                                             |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| All Tests       | `make test`                                                         |
| All Golang      | `make gotest`                                                       |
| All Python      | `make pytest`                                                       |
| Some/One Golang | `make gotest GOTEST_PKGS=./cmd/entrypoint GOTEST_ARGS="-run TestName"` |
| Some/One Python | `make pytest PYTEST_ARGS="-k TestName"`                             |

Please note the python tests use a local cache to speed up test
results. If you make a code update that changes the generated envoy
configuration, those tests will fail and you will need to update the
python test cache.

Note that it is invalid to run one of the `main[Plain.*]` Python tests
without running all of the other `main[Plain*]` tests; the test will
fail to run (not even showing up as a failure or xfail--it will fail
to run at all).  For example, `PYTEST_ARGS="-k WebSocket"` would match
the `main[Plain.WebSocketMapping-GRPC]` test, and that test would fail
to run; one should instead say `PYTEST_ARGS="-k Plain or WebSocket"`
to avoid breaking the sub-tests of "Plain".

### How do I update the python test cache?

- First, run `make KAT_RUN_MODE=envoy pytest` to do a test run *without*
  using the local cache.

- Once that succeeds, use `make pytest-gold` to update the cache from
  the passing tests.

### How do I type check my python code?

Ambassador uses Python 3 type hinting and the `mypy` static type checker to
help find bugs before runtime. If you haven't worked with hinting before, a
good place to start is
[the `mypy` cheat sheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cheat_sheet_py3.html).

New code must be hinted, and the build process will verify that the type
check passes when you `make test`. Fair warning: this means that
PRs will not pass CI if the type checker fails.

We strongly recommend using an editor that can do realtime type checking
(at Datawire we tend to use PyCharm and VSCode a lot, but many many editors
can do this now) and also running the type checker by hand before submitting
anything:

- `make mypy` will start check all the Ambassador code

Since `make mypy` uses the daemon for caching, it should be very fast after
the first run. Ambassador code should produce *no* warnings and *no* errors.

If you're concerned that the cache is somehow wrong (or if you just want the
daemon to not be there any more), `make mypy-clean` will stop the daemon
and clear the cache.

### How do I get the source code for a release?

The current shipping release of Ambassador lives on the `master`
branch. It is tagged with its version (e.g. `v0.78.0`).

Changes on `master` after the last tag have not been released yet, but
will be included in the next release of Ambassador.
