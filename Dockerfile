# This Dockerfile copies in the required packages from the CACHED_CONTAINER_IMAGE and configures
# Ambassador. The reason packages are not installed and copied instead is that this pattern speeds up
# the inner development loop, since packages do not need to be installed in every docker build.
# Besides that, alpine mirrors have been found to be inconsistent over timezones, so this seems to
# be a better approach.

# Seeing weird errors copying stuff? Check .dockerignore!!

# By default, Ambassador's config and other application-specific stuff gets written to /ambassador. You can
# configure a different location for the runtime configuration elements via environment variables.
