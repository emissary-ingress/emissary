# `include`ing this file on its own does not introduce a dependency on
# `go`, but:
#   - Calling the `build-aux.bin-go.rule` function introduces a hard
#     dependency Go 1.11.4+.
#   - Using the $(FLOCK) executable introduces a hard dependency on Go
#     1.11+ on systems that don't have a native `flock(1)` program
#     (macOS).

# the `prelude_*.mk` files is allowed to be eager, so ordering doesn't
# matter.  Anything eager must go in this main `prelude.mk` file.

# Targets

# Sometimes we have a file-target that we want Make to always try to
# re-generate (such as compiling a Go program; we would like to let
# `go install` decide whether it is up-to-date or not, rather than
# trying to teach Make how to do that).  We could mark it as .PHONY,
# but that tells Make that "this isn't a "this isn't a real file that
# I expect to ever exist", which has a several implications for Make,
# most of which we don't want.  Instead, we can have them *depend* on
# a .PHONY target (which we'll name "FORCE"), so that they are always
# considered out-of-date by Make, but without being .PHONY themselves.
