# Utility rules

# For files that should only-maybe update when the rule runs, put ".stamp" on
# the left-side of the ":", and just go ahead and update it within the rule.
#
# ".stamp" should NEVER appear in a dependency list (that is, it
# should never be on the right-side of the ":"), save for in this rule
# itself.

# Specific rules

# For images we can either write rules for
#  - `docker/.NAME.img.tar.stamp` for ocibuild-oriented images, or
#  - `docker/.NAME.docker.stamp` for `docker build`-oriented images.
#
# Note that there are a few images used by the test suite that are
# defined in check.mk, rather than here.

# base: Base OS; none of our specific stuff.  Used for auxiliar test images
# that don't need Emissary-specif stuff.

# base-python: Base OS, plus some Emissary-specific setup of
# low-level/expensive pieces of the Python environment.  This does NOT
# include the packages installed by `requirements.txt`.
#
# At the moment, it also includes some other stuff too (kubectl...),
# but including those things at such an early stage should be
# understood to be debt from a previous build system, and not
# something we're actually happy with.
#
# In the long-run, this will likely always be a `docker build` rather
# than an `ocibuild`, in order to do truly base-OS-specific setup
# (`apk add`, libc-specific compilation...).
