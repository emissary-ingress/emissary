# Functions

# Usage: $(call joinlist,SEPARATOR,LIST)
# Example: $(call joinlist,/,foo bar baz) => foo/bar/baz
joinlist=$(if $(word 2,$2),$(firstword $2)$1$(call joinlist,$1,$(wordlist 2,$(words $2),$2)),$2)

# Usage: $(call path.trimprefix,PREFIX,LIST)
# Example: $(call path.trimprefix,foo/bar,foo/bar foo/bar/baz) => . baz
path.trimprefix = $(patsubst $1/%,%,$(patsubst $1,$1/.,$2))

# Usage: $(call path.addprefix,PREFIX,LIST)
# Example: $(call path.addprefix,foo/bar,. baz) => foo/bar foo/bar/baz
path.addprefix = $(patsubst %/.,%,$(addprefix $1/,$2))

# Usage: $(call quote.shell,STRING)
# Example: $(call quote.shell,some'string"with`special characters) => "some'string\"with\`special characters"
#

# Configure how Make works

# Turn off .INTERMEDIATE file removal by marking all files as
# .SECONDARY.  .INTERMEDIATE file removal is a space-saving hack from
# a time when drives were small; on modern computers with plenty of
# storage, it causes nothing but headaches.
#
# https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16486331
.SECONDARY:

# If a recipe errors, remove the target it was building.  This
# prevents outdated/incomplete results of failed runs from tainting
# future runs.  The only reason .DELETE_ON_ERROR is off by default is
# for historical compatibility.
#
# If for some reason this behavior is not desired for a specific
# target, mark that target as .PRECIOUS.
.DELETE_ON_ERROR:

# Sometimes we have a file-target that we want Make to always try to
# re-generate (such as compiling a Go program; we would like to let
# `go install` decide whether it is up-to-date or not, rather than
# trying to teach Make how to do that).  We could mark it as .PHONY,
# but that tells Make that "this isn't a "this isn't a real file that
# I expect to ever exist", which has a several implications for Make,
# most of which we don't want.  Instead, we can have them *depend* on
# a .PHONY target (which we'll name "FORCE"), so that they are always
# considered out-of-date by Make, but without being .PHONY themselves.
.PHONY: FORCE
