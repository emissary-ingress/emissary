# Datawire build-aux

This is a collection of Makefile snippets (and associated utilities)
for use in Datawire projects.

It has the following downsides:
 1. It does not support out-of-tree builds.
 2. It has no notion of nesting.  You cannot `cd` to a sub-directory,
    run `make`, and have it just build the stuff in that directory.
 3. It has no notion of nesting.  If you want per-directory build
    descriptions, you'll have to build that functionality yourself, or
    offload it to a separate build-system, like `go` or `setup.py`.
 4. Most of the `.mk` snippets have a hard dependency on the `go`
    program being in `PATH`, even if none of the sources are Go.

If any of those are a bummer, but you still want the "Make snippets in
a `./build-aux/` folder" concept, consider
[Autothing](https://git.lukeshu.com/autothing/) (which has the
downsides that it requires GNU Make 3.82 or above, and is slow).

At Datawire, those are good trade-offs, since:
 - We're mostly a Python and Go shop (we don't care about #2 or #3,
   and only care about #4 for Python-only projects).
 - I've never heard anyone here even mention out-of-tree builds (#1).
 - We need to support macOS (which still ships GNU Make 3.81, as it's
   the last GPLv2 version) and the Ubuntu 14.04 images that CircleCI
   uses (which ship 3.81) (so Autothing is ruled out).

## How to use

Add `build-aux.git` as `build-aux/` in the git repository of the
project that you want to use this from.  I recommend that you do this
using `git subtree`, but `git submodule` is fine too.

Then, in your Makefile, write `include build-aux/FOO.mk` for each
common bit of functionality that you want to make use of.

### Using `git-subtree` to manage `./build-aux/`

 - Start using build-aux:

		$ git subtree add --squash --prefix=build-aux git@github.com:datawire/build-aux.git master

 - Update to latest build-aux:

		$ ./build-aux/build-aux-pull

 - Push "vendored" changes upstream to build-aux.git:

		$ ./build-aux/build-aux-push

### Documentation

 - Each `.mk` snippet contains a reference-quality header comment
   identifying
    - any inputs (mostly variables)
    - any outputs (targets, variables)
    - which targets from other snippets it hooks in to (mostly hooking
      in to `common.mk` targets)
 - [`docs/intro.md`](./docs/intro.md) is an introduction to
   big-picture ideas in `*.mk` snippets.
 - [`docs/golang.md`](./docs/golang.md) discusses support for building
   software written in Go.
 - [`docs/testing.md`](./docs/testing.md) discusses adding tests to
   `make check`.
 - [`HACKING.md`](./HACKING.md) has guidelines for contributing to
   `build-aux.git`.
