#
#     .DEFAULT_GOAL = help
#     include build-aux/help.mk
#
#     my-rule: ## A description of my-rule
#     my-rule: dep1 dep2
#             recipe
#     .PHONY: my-rule
#
#     my-other-rule: ## (Category) A description of my-other-rule
#     my-other-rule: dep1 dep2
#             recipe
#     .PHONY: my-other-rule
#
# The double "##" is important.  It is also important that there be no
# dependencies between the ":" and the "##"; any ammount of whitespace
# is acceptable, though.  The "##" may optionally be followed by a
# category in parenthesis.

#     This is a short little paragraph that goes between the "Usage:"
#     header and the "TARGETS:" footer that can give more information.
#     It can contain any kind of 'quotes' or shell
#     "meta"-`characters`.  Make $(variables) do get expanded, though.

# If a target doesn't specify a category name, then we use $(NAME) as
# the category name.  We used to use "-", but the en_US.UTF-8 locale
# ignores non-letter characters.  So showing "-" in the category
# column for non-categorized targets meant that `sort` would be
# looking at the second column for those rows, which would,
# potentially split the non-categorized targets:

#      (Common)     build            Build the software
#      (Common)     check            Check whether the software works; run the tests

#      (Common)     clobber          Delete all files that this Makefile can re-generate

#
# Using $(NAME) (falling back to "this project", since `help.mk`
# doesn't assume you set NAME) as the default category name solves
# this, and makes it clear what no-category means (since all
# build-aux.git targets now declare a category).
