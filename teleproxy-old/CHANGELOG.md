## CHANGELOG

This changelog covers edgectl, teleproxy, watt, kubeapply, k3sctl,
kubestatus, and the various libraries that they use.  Lines within
each entry are prefixed with <b>[`<name>`]</b> to indicate what they
refer to.

## 0.7.3 (TBD)

 * The `go.mod` dependency list should now be less problematic; upgrade consul 1.4.4â†’1.5.0.
 * <b>[edgectl]</b> Better output.
 * <b>[edgectl]</b> `su`/`sudo` bug fixed.
 * <b>[k3sctl]</b> Bug fix: More robust readiness check.
 * <b>[kubeapply]</b> Accept `--filename` in addition to `-f`, just like `kubectl apply`.
 * <b>[teleproxy]</b> Once again works properly for services with multiple ports.
 * <b>[lib/dlog]</b> Added.
 * <b>[lib/dtest/testprocess]</b> Enhancement: Don't require the use of `sudo`.
 * <b>[lib/exec]</b> Added.
 * <b>[lib/k8s]</b> BREAKING CHANGE: Many things moved to <b>[lib/kubeapply]</b>.
 * <b>[lib/kubeapply]</b> Added.

## 0.7.2 (2019-08-21)

 * <b>[kubestatus]</b> Bug fix: kubestatus will work properly on non namespaced resources.
 * <b>[lib/k8s]</b> Bug fix: WatchQuery and ListQuery will now ignore namespace for non namespaced resources.

## 0.7.1 (2019-08-20)

 * <b>[kubestatus]</b> Bug fix: update would error out when resource short names are ambiguous.

## 0.7.0 (2019-08-16)

 * <b>[edgectl]</b> Initial release of [edgectl](docs/edgectl.md).
 * <b>[teleproxy]</b> Switched to GNU-style long arguments.
 * <b>[teleproxy]</b> Bug fix: teleproxy now handles SIGHUP more gracefully by reloading kubernetes config info instead of dying and leaving the network messed up
 * <b>[k3sctl]</b> Initial release of the k3sctl -- a utility for managing a local test cluster and registry.
 * <b>[kubestatus]</b> Added this CLI utility for updating Kubernetes object status.
 * <b>[kubeapply]</b> Switched to GNU-style long arguments.
 * <b>[kubeapply]</b> Changed the timeout argument to allow any duration unit rather than just seconds.
 * <b>[kubeapply]</b> Added a --dry-run flag.
 * <b>[kubeapply]</b> Added command-line arguments for --kubeconfig, --context, and --namespace
 * <b>[kubeapply]</b> Added an image template function that provides simple docker build functionality
 * <b>[kubeapply]</b> Bug fix: wait for resources in the correct namespace
 * <b>[lib/k8s]</b> BREAKING CHANGE: KubeInfo has changed to use `k8s.io/cli-runtime/pkg/genericclioptions`.

## 0.6.0 (2019-06-01)

 * <b>[lib/k8s] [watt] [teleproxy] [kubeapply]</b> Bug fix: lookup of kubernetes resources should now behave just like kubectl, e.g. allowing for `<name>.<version>.<group>` syntax in order to disambiguate resources with the same short names. ([teleproxy#127](https://github.com/datawire/teleproxy/issues/127)) This change is not intended to break compatibility, however it is a fairly extensive change to a pretty fundamental piece of code and so we are bumping the version number to 0.6.0 because of this. Any software that uses any of these components should perform additional testing around how they pass in kubernetes names. It would also be advisable to update kubernetes names to make them fully qualified.
 * <b>[teleproxy]</b> Bug fix: the self check should only be run when the process is doing intercept.
 * <b>[lib/dtest]</b> Added utility code for testing subprocesses and applying manifests from inside go test code.

## 0.5.1 (2019-05-21)

 * <b>[watt]</b> Improved error reporting for unrecognized kubernetes resources.

## 0.5.0 (2019-05-20)

 * <b>[teleproxy]</b> Added support for intercepting specific ports rather than just blanket ip addresses.

## 0.4.12 (2019-05-17)

 * <b>[watt]</b> Only invoke the watch hook when we are bootstrapped with respect to our initial set of sources.
 * <b>[lib/supervisor]</b> Added Process.DoClean().
 * <b>[lib/supervisor]</b> Added smart (rate limited) logging of workers that are blocked.

## 0.4.11 (2019-05-16)

 * <b>[teleproxy]</b> Added self check to avoid starting up despite not functioning properly.
 * <b>[teleproxy]</b> Bug fix: internal startup race

## 0.4.10 (2019-05-08)

 * <b>[watt]</b> Bug fix: interpolated addresses cause watt to never reach bootstrapped stage ([teleproxy#110](https://github.com/datawire/teleproxy/issues/110))

## 0.4.9 (2019-05-06)

 * <b>[teleproxy]</b> Made teleproxy log start with a legend for what different prefixes mean, so its more self documenting.
 * <b>[teleproxy]</b> Switch teleproxy over to using Supervisor library for increased startup/shutdown robustness.
 * <b>[teleproxy]</b> Removed all known occurrances of fatals and exits from teleproxy code in order to increase robustness of firewall cleanup on exit.
 * <b>[teleproxy]</b> Fixed docker integration to work with more recent versions of docker.
 * <b>[teleproxy]</b> Bug fix: log all dns queries (not just ones we intercept).
 * <b>[lib/supervisor]</b> Added supervisor support for launching subprocesses in a way that automatically logs input, output, and exit codes.

 * <b>[lib/supervisor]</b> Added supervisor.Run and supervisor.MustRun for convenience.

## 0.4.3 (2019-04-22)
