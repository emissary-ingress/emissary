class ACResource (Resource):
    """
    A resource that we're going to use as part of the Ambassador configuration.

    Elements in a Resource:
    - rkey is a short identifier that is used as the primary key for _all_ the
    Ambassador classes to identify this single specific resource. It should be
    something like "ambassador-default.1" or the like: very specific, doesn't
    have to be fun for humans.

    - location is a more human-readable string describing where the human should
    go to find the source of this resource. "Service ambassador, namespace default,
    object 1". This isn't really used by the Config class, but the Diagnostics class
    makes heavy use of it.

    - kind (keyword-only) is what kind of Ambassador resource this is.

    - name (keyword-only) is the name of the Ambassador resource.

    - apiVersion (keyword-only) specifies the API version in use. It defaults to
      "getambassador.io/v0" if not specified.

    - serialization (keyword-only) is the _original input serialization_, if we have
      it, of the object. If we don't have it, this should be None -- don't just serialize
      the object to no purpose.

    - any additional keyword arguments are saved in the Resource.

    :param rkey: unique identifier for this source, should be short
    :param location: where should a human go to find the source of this resource?
    :param kind: what kind of thing is this?
    :param name: what's the name of this thing?
    :param namespace: what namespace is this in?
    :param metadata_labels: what label did we select to get this thing?
    :param apiVersion: API version, defaults to "getambassador.io/v0" if not present
    :param serialization: original input serialization of obj, if we have it
    :param kwargs: key-value pairs that form the data object for this resource
