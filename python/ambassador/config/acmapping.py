## mapping.py -- the mapping configuration object for Ambassador
##
## Each Mapping object has a group_id that reflects the group of Mappings
## that it is a part of. By definition, two Mappings with the same group_id
## are reflecting a single mapped resource that's going to multiple services.
## This implies that Mapping.group_id() is a very, very, very important
## thing that can have dramatic customer impact if changed! (At some point,
## we should probably allow the human writing the Mapping to override the
## grouping, in much the same way we allow overriding precedence.)
##
## Each Mapping object also has a weight, which is used for ordering. The
## default is computing in Mapping.route_weight(), but it can be overridden
## using the precedence field in the Mapping object.

# StringOrBool = Union[str, bool]
# DictOfStringOrBool = Dict[str, StringOrBool]
