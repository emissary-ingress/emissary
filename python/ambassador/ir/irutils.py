## disable_strict_selectors is a utility function to control the behaviour of label selectors for Host/Mapping association
## and serves to provide a single place where the default value can be updated.
##
## Ambassador (2.0-2.3) & (3.0-3.1) consider a match on a single label as a "good enough" match.
## In versions 2.5+ and 3.2+ _ALL_ labels in a selector must be present for it to be considered a match.
## DISABLE_STRICT_LABEL_SELECTORS provides a way to restore the old unintended loose matching behaviour
## in the event that it is desired. The ability to disable strict label matching will be removed in a future version
