class Resource (dict):
    """
    A resource that's part of the overall Ambassador configuration world. This is
    the base class for IR resources, Ambassador-config resources, etc.

    Elements in a Resource:
    - rkey is a short identifier that is used as the primary key for _all_ the
    Ambassador classes to identify this single specific resource. It should be
    something like "ambassador-default.1" or the like: very specific, doesn't
    have to be fun for humans.

    - location is a more human-readable string describing where the human should
    go to find the source of this resource. "Service ambassador, namespace default,
    object 1". This isn't really used by the Config class, but the Diagnostics class
    makes heavy use of it.

    - kind (keyword-only) is what kind of Ambassador resource this is.

    - serialization (keyword-only) is the _original input serialization_, if we have
    it, of the object. If we don't have it, this should be None -- don't just serialize
    the object to no purpose.

    - any additional keyword arguments are saved in the Resource.

    :param kind: what kind of thing is this?
