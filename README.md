----

[Emissary-Ingress](https://www.getambassador.io) is an open-source Kubernetes-native API Gateway +
Layer 7 load balancer + Kubernetes Ingress built on [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io). 
Emissary-ingress is an CNCF incubation project (and was formerly known as Ambassador API Gateway.)

Emissary-ingress enables its users to:
* Manage ingress traffic with [load balancing], support for multiple protocols ([gRPC and HTTP/2], [TCP], and [web sockets]), and Kubernetes integration
* Manage changes to routing with an easy to use declarative policy engine and [self-service configuration], via Kubernetes [CRDs] or annotations
* Secure microservices with [authentication], [rate limiting], and [TLS]
* Ensure high availability with [sticky sessions], [rate limiting], and [circuit breaking]
* Leverage observability with integrations with [Grafana], [Prometheus], and [Datadog], and comprehensive [metrics] support
* Enable progressive delivery with [canary releases]
* Connect service meshes including [Consul], [Linkerd], and [Istio]
* [Knative serverless integration]

See the full list of [features](https://www.getambassador.io/features/) here.

Architecture
============

Emissary is configured via Kubernetes CRDs, or via annotations on Kubernetes `Service`s. Internally,
it uses the [Envoy Proxy] to actually handle routing data; externally, it relies on Kubernetes for
scaling and resiliency. For more on Emissary's architecture and motivation, read [this blog post](https://blog.getambassador.io/building-ambassador-an-open-source-api-gateway-on-kubernetes-and-envoy-ed01ed520844).

Getting Started
===============

You can get Emissary up and running in just three steps. Follow the instructions here: https://www.getambassador.io/docs/emissary/latest/tutorials/getting-started/

If you are looking for a Kubernetes ingress controller, Emissary provides a superset of the functionality of a typical ingress controller. (It does the traditional routing, and layers on a raft of configuration options.) This blog post covers [Kubernetes ingress](https://blog.getambassador.io/kubernetes-ingress-nodeport-load-balancers-and-ingress-controllers-6e29f1c44f2d).

For other common questions, view this [FAQ page](https://www.getambassador.io/docs/emissary/latest/about/faq/).

You can also use Helm to install Emissary. For more information, see the instructions in the [Helm installation documentation](https://www.getambassador.io/docs/emissary/latest/topics/install/helm/)
