# Ambassador Pro [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/datawire/apro.svg?style=svg&circle-token=81544a8dc30c28df7705975ad2dd4bfee63b653b)](https://circleci.com/gh/datawire/apro)

This is the proprietary Ambassador Pro source-code.  The public
user-facing documentation and issue-tracking lives at
<https://github.com/datawire/ambassador-pro>.

## CI/CD and manual release

### Continuous Integration

On every Git branch, tag, and pull request, CircleCI runs:
 - the `go test` unit tests on Ubuntu and macOS
 - the e2e tests on Ubuntu+Kubernaut+`ambassador-oauth-e2e.auth0.com`

It does NOT push Docker images to any persistent registry for normal
CI runs (it pushes the test images to an ephemeral registry inside of
the Kubernaut cluster).

### Continuous Deployment

On Git tags matching `vX.Y.Z[-PRE]` (for integers `X`, `Y`, `Z`, and
arbitrary string `PRE`), CircleCI does the
[above](#continuous-integration), and (assuming the tests pass),
proceeds to:
 - push `apictl` and `apictl-key` for Linux and Darwin to AWS S3
 - push all 4 Docker images to
   [`quay.io/datawire/ambassador_pro`](https://quay.io/repository/datawire/ambassador_pro?tab=tags)

### Manual release

If you would like to push a development version without tagging a
release or pre-release, you may run

    $ make release

which will build and push a release with the pseudo-version generated
by `git describe --tags`.  You will need the appropriate Quay and AWS
credentials.

## Local development

### Building

    $ make build

This will build
 - all executable programs, which it will put in
   `./bin_$(go env GOOS)_$(go env GOARCH)/`
 - all Docker images, which it will tag as
   `localhost:31000/$(IMAGE_NAME):$(VERSION)` (or
   `host.docker.internal:31000` on macOS).

### Testing

    $ # if on macOS, first you must configure dockerd, see below
    $ export KUBERNAUT_TOKEN=...
    $ make check

This will run both unit tests and e2e tests.

 > *NOTE:* This will talk to the Auth0 account configured in
 > `./k8s-env.sh`.  The login credentials for that Auth0 account can
 > be found in Keybase under
 > `/datawireio/global/ambassador-oauth-ci.txt`.

On macOS, you will first need to add `host.docker.internal:31000` to
Docker's list of "Insecure registries":

## Documentation

The documentation lives in
<https://github.com/datawire/ambassador-docs>, which is included in
this repository at `./docs/` as a `git subtree`.  Functionality
changes that require changes or updates to documentation should have
those documentation changes to `./docs/` included in the PR.

Any new documentation pages that are Pro-only should be mentioned in
`./docs/pro-pages.yml`.

## Cutting an RC or non-publicized release

Simply create a Git tag, and push that Git tag.  e.g.:

    $ git tag v0.1.2-rc3
    $ git push origin v0.1.2-rc3

See [Continuous Deployment](#continuous-deployment) above for
information on what this does, and on the format of the tag names.

## Cutting a GA release

1. Ensure that any Ambassador documentation changes have been merged:

        $ make pull-docs

2. Update `./docs/versions.yml` to use the new version number, and
   commit that (with a commit message like "Prepare release").

3. Tag and push that commit:

        $ git tag v0.1.2
        $ git push origin v0.1.2 master

   See [Continuous Deployment](#continuous-deployment) above for
   information on what this does, and on the format of the tag names.

   This will publish Docker images, `apictl`, and associated
   artifacts, but won't yet publicize it on the website.

4. (this step may be performed before CI for step 3 had finished)
   Create a PR against <https://github.com/datawire/pro-ref-arch> that
   updates it for the new version.  This may be as simple as updating
   the version numbers in the several YAML files that mention it.

5. (CI for step 3 must finish before performing this step) Create a PR
   against <https://github.com/datawire/apro-example-plugin> that
   bumps `Makefile:APRO_VERSION` to the new version.  Run `make` to
   verify whether any `go.mod` changes are necessary when updating a
   plugin to the new version.  If `go.mod` changes are necessary, make
   them and include them in the PR.

6. Put the release through manual acceptance testing.  If there are
   zero changes (other than bumping `docs/versions.yml`) from an RC
   that has gone through acceptance testing, it may be possible to
   skip this step.

   Test the different modules in `pro-ref-arch` by following the
   individual READMEs.

   Once the release has been sufficiently tested, and you are ready to
   publicize it, proceed.

7. From apro.git, with the tag version tag checked out, run `make
   push-docs`:

        $ git checkout v0.1.2
        $ make push-docs

8. Merge the `pro-ref-arch` PR created in step 4.

9. Merge the `apro-example-plugin` PR created in step 5.
