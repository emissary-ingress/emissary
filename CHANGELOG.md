# Changelog

## BREAKING NEWS

- In Ambassador 0.36.0, the Envoy dynamic value `%CLIENT_IP%` is no longer supported. Use `%DOWNSTREAM_REMOTE_ADDRESS_WITHOUT_PORT%` instead. (This is due to a change in Envoy 1.7.0.)

- **Ambassador 0.35.0 resupports websockets, with the important caveat that a websocket cannot have multiple upstream services**.
  - This means that you cannot do canary deployments for websockets.
    We're actively working on fixing this.
  - Multiple websocket `Mapping`s are still supported.

- Ambassador version 0.35.0 supports running as a non-root user, to improve security and work on other Kubernetes runtimes (e.g. OpenShift). **Running as non-root will become the default in a future Ambassador release; this will be a breaking change.** We recommend proactively switching to non-root now:
    - Use a `securityContext` in your Ambassador `Deployment` to switch to a non-root user.
    - Set the `service_port` element in the `ambassador` `Module` to a port number greater than 1024. (Ambassador's defaults will change to 8080 for cleartext and 8443 for TLS.)
    - Make sure that incoming traffic to Ambassador routes to the `service_port`. The most likely required change is the `targetPort` in the Kubernetes `Service` resource for Ambassador.
    - If you are using `redirect_cleartext_from`, change the value of this field to match the value you set in `service_port`.
    - If you have modified Ambassador's behavior around TLS certificates using a custom Ambassador build, please contact Datawire for more information.

- Ambassador versions **0.34.2** and **0.34.3** cannot support websockets; see the **WARNING** above. This bug is fixed in Ambassador 0.35.0.

- As of **0.28.0**, Ambassador supports Envoy's `use_remote_address` capability, as described in [the Envoy documentation](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http_conn_man/headers.html). Ambassador's default is currently not to include `use_remote_address`, but **this will soon change** to a default value of `true`.

   - Interested in testing Helm? See below!
- disable Istio automatic sidecar injection (thanks @majelbstoat!)
- clean up some doc issues (thanks @lavoiedn and @endrec!)

To test Helm, make sure you have `helm` installed and that you have `tiller` properly set up for your RBAC configuration. Then:

```
helm repo add datawire https://www.getambassador.io

helm upgrade --install --wait my-release datawire/ambassador
```

You can also use `adminService.type=LoadBalancer`.

## [0.30.1] March 26, 2018
[0.30.1]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.30.0...v0.30.1

### Fixed

[0.29.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.28.2...v0.29.0

### Changed

- Default restart timings have been increased. **This will cause Ambassador to respond to service changes less quickly**; by default, you'll see changes appear within 15 seconds.
- Liveness and readiness checks are now enabled after 30 seconds, rather than 3 seconds, if you use our published YAML.
- The `statsd` container is now based on `mhart/alpine-node:9` rather than `:7`.

## [0.28.1] March 5, 2018 (and [0.28.0] on March 2, 2018)
[0.28.1]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.26.0...v0.28.1
[0.28.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.26.0...v0.28.1

(Note that 0.28.1 is identical to 0.28.0, and 0.27.0 was an internal release. These are related to the way CI generates tags, which we'll be revamping soon.)

### Changed

- Support tuning Envoy restart parameters
- Support `host_regex`, `method_regex`, and `regex_headers` to allow regular expression matches in `Mappings`
- Support `use_proxy_proto` and `use_remote_address` in the `ambassador` module
- Fine-tune the way we sort a `Mapping` based on its constraints
- Support manually setting the `precedence` of a `Mapping`, so that there's an escape hatch when the automagic sorting gets it wrong

  - GKE
  - Ambassador + Istio
  - Ordering of `Mappings`
  - Prometheus with Ambassador

### Changed

- Clean up build docs (thanks @alexgervais!)
- Support `add_request_headers` for, uh, adding requests headers (thanks @alexgervais!)
- Make end-to-end tests and Travis build process a bit more robust
- Pin to Kubernaut 0.1.39
- Document the use of the `develop` branch
- Don't default to `imagePullAlways`

## [0.22.0] January 17, 2017
[0.22.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.21.1...v0.22.0

### Changed

- Switched to using `quay.io` rather than DockerHub. **If you are not using Datawire's published Kubernetes manifests, you will have to update your manifests!**
- Switched to building over Alpine rather than Ubuntu. (We're still using an unstripped Envoy; that'll change soon.)
- Switched to a proper production configuration for the `statsd` pod, so that it hopefully chews up less memory.
- Make sure that Ambassador won't generate cluster names that are too long for Envoy.
- Fix a bug where Ambassador could crash if there were too many egregious errors in its configuration.

## [0.21.1] January 11, 2017
[0.21.1]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.21.0...v0.21.1

### Changed

- Ambassador will no longer generate cluster names that exceed Envoy's 60-character limit.

## [0.21.0] January 3, 2017
[0.21.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.20.1...v0.21.0

### Changed

- If `AMBASSADOR_SINGLE_NAMESPACE` is present in the environment, Ambassador will only look for services in its own namespace.
- Ambassador `Mapping` objects now correctly support `host_redirect`, `path_redirect`, `host_rewrite`, `auto_host_rewrite`, `case_sensitive`, `use_websocket`, `timeout_ms`, and `priority`.

## [0.20.1] December 22, 2017
[0.20.1]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.20.0...v0.20.1

### Changed

- If Ambassador finds an empty YAML document, it will now ignore it rather than raising an exception.
- Includes the namespace of a service from an annotation in the name of its generated YAML file.
- Always process inputs in the same order from run to run.

## [0.20.0] December 18, 2017
[0.20.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.19.2...v0.20.0

### Changed

- Switch to Envoy 1.5 under the hood.
- Refocus the diagnostic service to better reflect what's actually visible when you're working at Ambassador's level.
- Allow the diagnostic service to display, and change, the Envoy log level.

## [0.19.2] December 12, 2017
[0.19.2]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.19.1...v0.19.2

### Changed

- Arrange for logs from the subsystem that watches for Kubernetes service changes (kubewatch) to have timestamps and such.
- Only do new-version checks every four hours.

## [0.19.1] December 4, 2017
[0.19.1]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.19.0...v0.19.1

### Changed

- Allow the diag service to look good (well, OK, not too horrible anyway) when Ambassador is running with TLS termination.
- Show clusters on the overview page again.
- The diag service now shows you the "health" of a cluster by computing it from the number of requests to a given service that didn't involve a 5xx status code, rather than just forwarding Envoy's stat, since we don't configure Envoy's stat in a meaningful way yet.
- Make sure that the tests correctly reported failures (sigh).
- Allow updating out-of-date diagnostic reports without requiring multiple test runs.

## [0.19.0] November 30, 2017
[0.19.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.18.2...v0.19.0

### Changed

- Ambassador can now use HTTPS upstream services: just use a `service` that starts with `https://` to enable it.
  - By default, Ambassador will not offer a certificate when using HTTPS to connect to a service, but it is possible to configure certificates. Please [contact us on Slack](https://d6e.co/slack) if you need to do this.
- HTTP access logs appear in the normal Kubernetes logs for Ambassador.
- It’s now possible to tell `ambassador config` to read Kubernetes manifests from the filesystem and build a configuration from the annotations in them (use the `--k8s` switch).
- Documentation on using Ambassador with Istio now reflects Ambassador 0.19.0 and Istio 0.2.12.

## [0.18.2] November 28, 2017
[0.18.2]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.18.0...v0.18.2

### Changed

- The diagnostics service will now tell you when updates are available.

## [0.18.0] November 20, 2017
[0.18.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.17.0...v0.18.0

### Changed

- The Host header is no longer overwritten when Ambassador talks to an external auth service. It will now retain whatever value the client passes there.

### Fixed

- Checks for updates weren’t working, and they have been restored. At present you’ll only see them in the Kubernetes logs if you’re using annotations to configure Ambassador — they’ll start showing up in the diagnostics service in the next release or so.

## [0.17.0] November 14, 2017
[0.17.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.16.0...v0.17.0

### Changed

- Allow Mappings to require matches on HTTP headers and `Host`
- Update tests, docs, and diagnostic service for header matching

### Fixed

### Changed

- Support configuring Ambassador via `annotations` on Kubernetes `service`s
- No need for volume mounts! Ambassador can read configuration and TLS-certificate information directly from Kubernetes to simplify your Kubernetes YAML
- Expose more configuration elements for Envoy `route`s: `host_redirect`, `path_redirect`, `host_rewrite`, `auto_host_rewrite`, `case_sensitive`, `use_websocket`, `timeout_ms`, and `priority` get transparently copied

### Fixed

- Reenable support for gRPC

## [0.15.0] October 16, 2017
[0.15.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.14.2...v0.15.0

### Changed

- Allow `docker run` to start Ambassador with a simple default configuration for testing
- Support `host_rewrite` in mappings to force the HTTP `Host` header value for services that need it
- Support `envoy_override` in mappings for odd situations

## [0.13.0] September 25, 2017
[0.13.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.12.1...v0.13.0

### Changed

- Support using IP addresses for services.
- Check for collisions, so that trying to e.g. map the same prefix twice will report an error.
- Enable liveness and readiness probes, and have Kubernetes perform them by default.
- Document the presence of the template-override escape hatch.

## [0.12.1] September 22, 2017
[0.12.1]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.12.0...v0.12.1

### Changed

- Notify (in the logs) if a new version of Ambassador is available.

## [0.12.0] September 21, 2017
[0.12.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.11.2...v0.12.0

### Changed

- Support for non-default Kubernetes namespaces.
- Infrastructure for checking if a new version of Ambassador is available.

### Changed

- Declarative Ambassador! Configuration is now via YAML files rather than REST calls
- The `ambassador-store` service is no longer needed.

## [0.10.14] September 15, 2017
[0.10.14]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.10.13...v0.10.14

### Fixed

- Update `demo-qotm.yaml` with the correct image tag.

## [0.10.13] September 5, 2017
[0.10.13]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.10.12...v0.10.13

### Changed

- Properly support proxying all methods to an external authentication service, with headers intact, rather than moving request headers into the body of an HTTP POST.

## [0.10.12] August 2, 2017
[0.10.12]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.10.10...v0.10.12

### Changed

- Make TLS work with standard K8s TLS secrets, and completely ditch push-cert and push-cacert.

### Fixed

- Move Ambassador out from behind Envoy, so that you can use Ambassador to fix things if you completely botch your Envoy config.
- Let Ambassador keep running if Envoy totally chokes and dies, but make sure the pod dies if Ambassador loses access to its storage.

[0.10.10]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.10.7...v0.10.10

### Fixed

- Fix broken doc paths and simplify building as a developer. 0.10.8, 0.10.9, and 0.10.10 were all stops along the way to getting this done; hopefully we'll be able to reduce version churn from here on out.
