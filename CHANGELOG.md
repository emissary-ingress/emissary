## BREAKING NEWS

### AMBASSADOR EDGE STACK 1.0.0

Ambassador Edge Stack 1.0.0 is a comprehensive, self-service solution for exposing,
securing, and managing the boundary between end users and your Kubernetes services.
The core of Ambassador Edge Stack is the open-source Ambassador API Gateway, built on
the Envoy proxy.

Ambassador Edge Stack provides all the capabilities of the Ambassador API Gateway,
as well as additional capabilities including:

- The Edge Policy Console, a graphical UI to visualize and manage all of your edge policies;
- Security features such as automatic TLS setup via ACME integration, OAuth/OpenID Connect
  integration, rate limiting, and fine-grained access control; and
- Developer onboarding assistance, including an API catalog, Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
  support, and a fully customizable developer portal.

Note: Ambassador Edge Stack replaces Ambassador Pro and can be installed over existing
instances of Ambassador Pro and Ambassador API Gateway. The Ambassador Edge Stack is free
for all users, and includes all the functionality of the Ambassador API Gateway in addition
to the additional capabilities mentioned above. Due to popular demand, weâ€™re offering a free
tier of our core features as part of the Ambassador Edge Stack, designed for startups.

### UPCOMING PROTOCOL CHANGES

*In a future version*, Ambassador will change the version of the gRPC service name used to
communicate with `AuthService`s and `RateLimitService`s:

| Resource           | Current service name                       | Upcoming service name                         |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| `AuthService`      | `envoy.service.auth.v2alpha.Authorization` | `envoy.service.auth.v2.Authorization`         |
| `RateLimitService` | `pb.lyft.ratelimit.RateLimitService`       | `envoy.service.ratelimit.v2.RateLimitService` |

- In some future version of Ambassador, there will be settings to control which name is
  used; with the default being the current name; it will be opt-in to the new names.
- In some future version of Ambassador after that, *no sooner than Ambassador 1.3.0*, the
  default values of those setting swill change; making them opt-out from the new names.
- In some future version of Ambassador after that, *no sooner than Ambassador 1.4.0*, the
  settings will go away, and Ambassador will always use the new names.

Note that Ambassador Edge Stack `External` Filters already unconditionally use the newer
`envoy.service.auth.v2.Authorization` name.

## [1.0.0] January 15, 2020
[1.0.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.86.1...v1.0.0

### Caution!

All of Ambassador's CRDs have been switched to `apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2`, and
**your resources will be upgraded when you apply the new CRDs**. We recommend that you
follow the [migration instructions](https://getambassador.io/early-access/user-guide/upgrade-to-edge-stack/) and check your installation's
behavior before upgrading your CRDs.

## Ambassador API Gateway + Ambassador Edge Stack

### Breaking changes

- When a resource specifies a service or secret name without a corresponding namespace, Ambassador will now
  look for the service or secret in the namespace of the resource that mentioned it. In the past, Ambassador
  would look in the namespace in which Ambassador was running.

### Features

- The Host CR provides an easy way to tell Ambassador about domains it should expect to handle, and
  how it should handle secure and insecure requests for those domains
- Redirection from HTTP to HTTPS defaults to ON when termination contexts are present
- Mapping and Host CRs, as well as Ingress resources, get Status updates to provide better feedback
- Improve performance of processing events from Kubernetes
- Automatic HTTPS should work with any ACME clients doing the http-01 challenge

### Bugfixes

- CORS now happens before rate limiting
- The reconfiguration engine is better protected from exceptions
- Donâ€™t try to check for upgrades on every UI snapshot update
- Reduced reconfiguration churn
- Don't force SNI routes to be lower-priority than non-SNI routes
- Knative mappings fallback to the Ambassador namespace if no namespace is specified
- Fix `ambassador_id` handling for Knative resources
- Treat `ambassadorId` as a synonym for `ambassador_id` (`ambassadorId` is the Protobuf 3 canonical form of `ambassador_id`)

## Ambassador Edge Stack

Ambassador Edge Stack incorporates the functionality of the old Ambassador Pro product.

- Authentication and ratelimiting are now available under a free community license
- Given a Host CR, Ambassador can manage TLS certificates using ACME (or you can manage them by hand)

### Changes since 0.60.2

- When scanning its configuration for secrets and endpoints that must be watched, 0.60.2 could fail with certain configurations if TLS termination but not origination was active. Those failures are fixed now.

## [0.60.2] April 29, 2019
[0.60.2]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/0.60.1...0.60.2

### Changes since 0.60.1

- Ambassador is now much more careful about which endpoints and secrets it pays attention to. ([#1465] again -- thanks to [@flands](https://github.com/flands) and @seandon for the help here!)

[#1465]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/issues/1465

## [0.60.1] April 25, 2019

## [0.60.0] April 23, 2019
[0.60.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/0.53.1...0.60.0

### Changes since 0.53.1

- BREAKING CHANGE: Ambassador listens on 8080 and 8443 by default so it does not need to run as root
- Ambassador natively supports using Consul for service discovery
- `AMBASSADOR_ENABLE_ENDPOINTS` is no longer needed; configure using the `Resolver` resource instead
- Support for the Maglev load balancing algorithm
- Support `connect_timeout_ms`. Thanks to PÃ©tur Erlingsson.
- Support for `idle_timeout_ms` Thanks to Aaron Triplett.
- Ambassador will properly reload renewed Let's Encrypt certificates (#1416). Thanks to Matthew Ceroni.
- Ambassador will now properly redirect from HTTP to HTTPS based on `x-forwarded-proto` (#1233).
- The `case_sensitive` field now works when `host_redirect` is set to true (#699). Thanks to Peter Choi and Christopher CotÃ©.

## [0.53.1] April 5, 2019
[0.53.1]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/0.52.1...0.53.1

(0.53.0 was immediately supplanted by 0.53.1.)

## SECURITY FIXES

Ambassador 0.53.1 addresses two security issues in Envoy Proxy, CVE-2019-9900 and CVE-2019-9901:

- CVE-2019-9900 (Score 8.3/High). When parsing HTTP/1.x header values, Envoy 1.9 and before does not reject embedded zero characters (NUL, ASCII 0x0).

- CVE-2019-9901 (Score 8.3/High). Envoy does not normalize HTTP URL paths in Envoy 1.9 and before.

Since these issues can potentially allow a remote attacker to use maliciously-crafted URLs to bypass
authentication, anyone running an Ambassador prior to 0.53.1 should upgrade.

### UPCOMING CHANGES

Ambassador 0.60 will listen on ports 8080/8443 by default. The diagnostics service in Ambassador 0.52.0
will try to warn you if your configuration will be affected by this change.

## Other changes since 0.52.1

- `AuthService` version `ambassador/v1` can now explicitly configure how much body data is sent
  to the external authentication service.

## [0.52.1] March 26, 2019
[0.52.1]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/0.52.0...0.52.1

### Changes since 0.52.0

- You can specify the `AMBASSADOR_NO_SECRETS` environment variable to prevent Ambassador from
  watching Kubernetes secrets at all (thanks [@esmet](https://github.com/esmet)!) ([#1293])
- The services used when you do `docker run ambassador --demo` have been moved into the Docker image,
  to remove external dependencies from the Ambassador quickstart.  

[#1293]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/issues/1293

## [0.52.0] March 21, 2019
[0.52.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/0.51.2...0.52.0

### Changes since 0.51.2

- Initial support for endpoint routing, rather than relying on `kube-proxy` ([#1031])
   - set `AMBASSADOR_ENABLE_ENDPOINTS` in the environment to allow this
- Initial support for Envoy ring hashing and session affinity (requires endpoint routing!)

[0.51.2]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/0.51.1...0.51.2

### Changes since 0.51.1

- Cookies are now correctly handled when using external auth services... really. ([#1211])

[#1211]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/issues/1211

## [0.51.1] March 11, 2019
[0.51.1]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/0.51.0...0.51.1

### Changes since 0.51.0

- Ambassador correctly handles services in namespaces other than the one Ambassador is running in.

## [0.51.0] March 8, 2019
[0.51.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/0.50.3...0.51.0

**0.51.0 is not recommended: upgrade to 0.51.1.**

### Changes since 0.50.3

- Ambassador can now route any TCP connection, using the new `TCPMapping` resource. ([#420])
- Cookies are now correctly handled when using external auth services ([#1211])
- Lots of work in docs and testing under the hood

[#420]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/issues/420
[#1211]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/issues/1211

### Limitations in 0.51.0

At present, you cannot mix HTTP and HTTPS upstream `service`s in any Ambassador resource. This restriction will be lifted in a future Ambassador release.

## [0.50.3] February 21, 2019
[0.50.3]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/0.50.2...0.50.3

### Fixes since 0.50.2

- Ambassador saves configuration snapshots as it manages configuration changes. 0.50.3 keeps only 5 snapshots,
  to bound its disk usage. The most recent snapshot has no suffix; the `-1` suffix is the next most recent, and
  the `-4` suffix is the oldest.
- Ambassador will not check for available updates more often than once every four hours.

### Limitations in 0.50.3

At present, you cannot mix HTTP and HTTPS upstream `service`s in any Ambassador resource. This restriction will be lifted in a future Ambassador release.

## [0.50.2] February 15, 2019
[0.50.2]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/0.50.1...0.50.2

### Important fixes since 0.50.1

- Ambassador no longer requires annotations in order to start -- with no configuration, it will launch with only the diagnostics service available. ([#1203])
- If external auth changes headers, routing will happen based on the changed values. ([#1226])

### Other changes since 0.50.1

- Ambassador will no longer log errors about Envoy statistics being unavaible before startup is complete ([#1216])
- The `tls` attribute is again available to control the client certificate offered by an `AuthService` ([#1202])

### Limitations in 0.50.2

At present, you cannot mix HTTP and HTTPS upstream `service`s in any Ambassador resource. This restriction will be lifted in a future Ambassador release.

**0.50.1 is not recommended: upgrade to 0.52.0.**

### Changes since 0.50.0

- Ambassador defaults to only doing IPv4 DNS lookups. IPv6 can be enabled in the Ambassador module or in a Mapping. ([#944])
- An invalid Envoy configuration should not cause Ambassador to hang.
- Testing using `docker run` and `docker compose` is supported again. ([#1160])
- Configuration from the filesystem is supported again, but see the "Running Ambassador" documentation for more.

**Ambassador 0.50.0 is a major rearchitecture of Ambassador onto Envoy V2 using the ADS. See the "BREAKING NEWS"
section above for more information.**

(Note that Ambassador 0.50.0-rc7 and -rc8 were internal releases.)

### Changes since 0.50.0-rc6

- `AMBASSADOR_SINGLE_NAMESPACE` is finally correctly supported and properly tested ([#1098])
- Ambassador won't throw an exception for name collisions between resources ([#1155])
- A TLS `Module` can now coexist with SNI (the TLS `Module` effectively defines a fallback cert) ([#1156])
- `ambassador dump --diag` no longer requires you to explicitly state `--v1` or `--v2`

### Limitations in 0.50.0 GA

- Configuration from the filesystem is not supported in 0.50.0. It will be resupported in 0.50.1.

- TLS origination certificates (including Istio mTLS) should now function [#1071]  
- The diagnostics service should function in all cases. [#1096]
- The Ambassador image is significantly (~500MB) smaller than RC4.

[0.50.0-rc4]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/0.50.0-rc3...0.50.0-rc4

**Ambassador 0.50.0-rc4 is a release candidate**, and fully supports running under Microsoft Azure.

### Changes since 0.50.0-rc3

- Ambassador fully supports running under Azure [#1039]
- The `proto` attribute of a v1 `AuthService` is now optional, and defaults to `http`
- Ambassador will warn about the use of v0 configuration resources.

## [0.50.0-rc3] January 3, 2019
[0.50.0-rc3]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/0.50.0-rc2...0.50.0-rc3

**Ambassador 0.50.0-rc3 is a release candidate**, but see below for an important warning about Azure.

### Microsoft Azure

There is a known issue with recently-created Microsoft Azure clusters where Ambassador will stop receiving service
updates after running for a short time. This will be fixed in 0.50.0-GA.

### Changes since 0.50.0-rc2

- The `Location` and `Set-Cookie` headers should always be allowed from the auth service when using an `ambassador/v0` config [#1054]
- `add_response_headers` (parallel to `add_request_headers`) is now supported (thanks, @n1koo!)
- `host_redirect` and `shadow` both now work correctly [#1057], [#1069]
- Kat is able to give better information when it cannot parse a YAML specification.

[0.50.0-rc2]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/0.50.0-rc1...0.50.0-rc2

**Ambassador 0.50.0-rc2 fixes some significant TLS bugs found in RC1.**

### Changes since 0.50.0-rc1:

- TLS client certificate verification should function correctly (including requiring client certs).
- TLS context handling (especially with multiple contexts and origination contexts) has been made more consistent and correct.
    - Ambassador is now much more careful about reporting errors in TLS configuration (especially around missing keys).
    - You can reference a secret in another namespace with `secret: $secret_name.$namespace`.
    - Ambassador will now save certificates loaded from Kubernetes to `$AMBASSADOR_CONFIG_BASE_DIR/$namespace/secrets/$secret_name`.
- `use_proxy_proto` should be correctly supported [#1050].
- `AuthService` v1 will default its `proto` to `http` (thanks @flands!)
- The JSON diagnostics service supports filtering: requesting `/ambassador/v0/diag/?json=true&filter=errors`, for example, will return only the errors element from the diagnostic output.

### Changes since 0.50.0-ea7:

- Websockets should work happily with external authentication [#1026]
- A `TracingService` using a long cluster name works now [#1025]
- TLS origination certificates are no longer offered to clients when Ambassador does TLS termination [#983]
- Ambassador will listen on port 443 only if TLS termination contexts are present; a TLS origination context will not cause the switch
- The diagnostics service is working, and correctly reporting errors, again. [#1019]
- `timeout_ms` in a `Mapping` works correctly again [#990]
- Ambassador sends additional anonymized usage data to help Datawire prioritize bug fixes, etc.
  See `docs/ambassador/running.md` for more information, including how to disable this function.

[0.50.0-ea7]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/0.50.0-ea6...0.50.0-ea7

**Ambassador 0.50.0-ea7 is an EARLY ACCESS release! IT IS NOT SUPPORTED FOR PRODUCTION USE.**

### Upcoming major changes:

- **API version `ambassador/v0` will be officially deprecated in Ambassador 0.50.0.**
  API version `ambassador/v1` will the minimum recommended version for resources in Ambassador 0.50.0.

- Some resources will change between `ambassador/v0` and `ambassador/v1`.
   - For example, the `Mapping` resource will no longer support `rate_limits` as that functionality will
     be subsumed by `labels`.   

### Changes since 0.50.0-ea6:

- Ambassador now supports `labels` for all `Mapping`s.
- Configuration of rate limits for a `Mapping` is now handled by providing `labels` in the domain configured
  for the `RateLimitService` (by default, this is "ambassador").    
- Ambassador, once again, supports `statsd` for statistics gathering.
- The Envoy `buffer` filter is supported.
- Ambassador can now use GRPC to call the external authentication service, and also include the message body
  in the auth call.
- It's now possible to use environment variables to modify the configuration directory (thanks @n1koo!).
- Setting environment variable `AMBASSADOR_KUBEWATCH_NO_RETRY` will cause the Ambassador pod to exit, and be
  rescheduled, if it loses its connection to the Kubernetes API server.
- Many dependencies have been updated, most notably including switching to kube-client 8.0.0.

[0.50.0-ea6]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/0.50.0-ea5...0.50.0-ea6

**Ambassador 0.50.0-ea6 is an EARLY ACCESS release! IT IS NOT SUPPORTED FOR PRODUCTION USE.**

### Changes since 0.50.0-ea5:

- `alpn_protocols` is now supported in the `TLS` module and `TLSContext`s
- Using `TLSContext`s to provide TLS termination contexts will correctly switch Ambassador to listening on port 443.
- `redirect_cleartext_from` is now supported with SNI
- Zipkin `TracingService` configuration now supports 128-bit trace IDs and shared span contexts (thanks, @alexgervais!)
- Zipkin should correctly trace calls to external auth services (thanks, @alexgervais!)
- `AuthService` configurations now allow separately configuring headers allowed from the client to the auth service, and from the auth service upstream
- Ambassador won't endlessly append `:annotation` to K8s resources
- The Ambassador CLI no longer requires certificate files to be present when dumping configurations
- `make mypy` will run full type checks on Ambassador to help developers

## [0.50.0-ea5] November 6, 2018
[0.50.0-ea5]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/0.50.0-ea4...0.50.0-ea5

**Ambassador 0.50.0-ea5 is an EARLY ACCESS release! IT IS NOT SUPPORTED FOR PRODUCTION USE.**

### Changes since 0.50.0-ea4:

- **`use_remote_address` is now set to `true` by default.** If you need the old behavior, you will need to manually set `use_remote_address` to `false` in the `ambassador` `Module`.
- Ambassador 0.50.0-ea5 **supports SNI!**  See the docs for more here.
- Header matching is now supported again, including `host` and `method` headers.

## [0.50.0-ea4] October 31, 2018
[0.50.0-ea4]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/0.50.0-ea3...0.50.0-ea4

**Ambassador 0.50.0-ea4 is an EARLY ACCESS release! IT IS NOT SUPPORTED FOR PRODUCTION USE.**

### Changes since 0.50.0-ea3:

- Ambassador 0.50.0-ea4 uses Envoy 1.8.0.
- `RateLimitService` is now supported. **You will need to restart Ambassador if you change the `RateLimitService` configuration.** We expect to lift this restriction in a later release; for now, the diag service will warn you when a restart is required.
   - The `RateLimitService` also has a new `timeout_ms` attribute, which allows overriding the default request timeout of 20ms.
- GRPC is provisionally supported, but still needs improvements in test coverage.  
- Ambassador will correctly include its EA number when checking for updates.

## [0.50.0-ea3] October 21, 2018
[0.50.0-ea3]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/0.50.0-ea2...0.50.0-ea3

**Ambassador 0.50.0-ea3 is an EARLY ACCESS release! IT IS NOT SUPPORTED FOR PRODUCTION USE.**

### Changes since 0.50.0-ea2:

- `TracingService` is now supported. **You will need to restart Ambassador if you change the `TracingService` configuration.** We expect to lift this restriction in a later release; for now, the diag service will warn you when a restart is required.
- Websockets are now supported, **including** mapping the same websocket prefix to multiple upstream services for canary releases or load balancing.
- KAT supports full debug logs by individual `Test` or `Query`.

**Ambassador 0.50.0 is not yet feature-complete. Read the Limitations and Breaking Changes sections in the 0.50.0-ea1 section below for more information.**

## [0.50.0-ea2] October 16, 2018
[0.50.0-ea2]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/0.50.0-ea1...0.50.0-ea2

**Ambassador 0.50.0-ea2 is an EARLY ACCESS release! IT IS NOT SUPPORTED FOR PRODUCTION USE.**

### Changes since 0.50.0-ea1:

- Attempting to enable TLS termination without supplying a valid cert secret will result in HTTP on port 80, rather than HTTP on port 443. **No error will be displayed in the diagnostic service yet.** This is a bug and will be fixed in `-ea3`.
- CORS is now supported.
- Logs are no longer full of accesses from the diagnostic service.
- KAT supports isolating OptionTests.
- The diagnostics service now shows the V2 config actually in use, not V1.
- `make` will no longer rebuild the Python venv so aggressively.

**Ambassador 0.50.0 is not yet feature-complete. Read the Limitations and Breaking Changes sections in the 0.50.0-ea1 section below for more information.**

## [0.50.0-ea1] October 11, 2018
[0.50.0-ea1]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/0.40.0...0.50.0-ea1

**Ambassador 0.50.0-ea1 is an EARLY ACCESS release! IT IS NOT SUPPORTED FOR PRODUCTION USE.**

### Ambassador 0.50.0 is not yet feature-complete. Limitations:

- `RateLimitService` and `TracingService` resources are not currently supported.
- WebSockets are not currently supported.
- CORS is not currently supported.
- GRPC is not currently supported.
- TLS termination is not  
- `statsd` integration has not been tested.
- The logs are very cluttered.
- Configuration directly from the filesystem isnâ€™t supported.
- The diagnostics service cannot correctly drill down by source file, though it can drill down by route or other resources.
- Helm installation has not been tested.
- `AuthService` does not currently have full support for configuring headers to be sent to the extauth service. At present it sends all the headers listed in `allowed_headers` plus:  
   - `Authorization`
   - `Cookie`
   - `Forwarded`
   - `From`
   - `Host`
   - `Proxy-Authenticate`
   - `Proxy-Authorization`
   - `Set-Cookie`
   - `User-Agent`
   - `X-Forwarded-For`
   - `X-Forwarded-Host`
   - `X-Forwarded`
   - `X-Gateway-Proto`
   - `WWW-Authenticate`

### **BREAKING CHANGES** from 0.40.0

- Configuration from a `ConfigMap` is no longer supported.
- The authentication `Module` is no longer supported; use `AuthService` instead (which you probably already were).
- External authentication now uses the core Envoy `envoy.ext_authz` filter, rather than the custom Datawire auth filter.
   - `ext_authz` speaks the same protocol, and your existing external auth services should work, however:
   - `ext_authz` does _not_ send all the request headers to the external auth service (see above in `Limitations`).
- Circuit breakers and outlier detection are not supported. They will be reintroduced in a later Ambassador release.
- Ambassador now _requires_ a TLS `Module` to enable TLS termination, where previous versions would automatically enable termation if the `ambassador-certs` secret was present. A minimal `Module` for the same behavior is:

        ---
        kind: Module
        name: tls
        config:
          server:
            secret: ambassador-certs

   - Interested in testing Helm? See below!
- disable Istio automatic sidecar injection (thanks @majelbstoat!)
- clean up some doc issues (thanks @lavoiedn and @endrec!)

To test Helm, make sure you have `helm` installed and that you have `tiller` properly set up for your RBAC configuration. Then:

```
helm repo add datawire https://www.getambassador.io

helm upgrade --install --wait my-release datawire/ambassador
```

You can also use `adminService.type=LoadBalancer`.

## [0.30.1] March 26, 2018
[0.30.1]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.30.0...v0.30.1

### Fixed

[0.28.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.26.0...v0.28.1

(Note that 0.28.1 is identical to 0.28.0, and 0.27.0 was an internal release. These are related to the way CI generates tags, which we'll be revamping soon.)

### Changed

- Support tuning Envoy restart parameters
- Support `host_regex`, `method_regex`, and `regex_headers` to allow regular expression matches in `Mappings`
- Support `use_proxy_proto` and `use_remote_address` in the `ambassador` module

- Support manually setting the `precedence` of a `Mapping`, so that there's an escape hatch when the automagic sorting gets it wrong
- Expose `alpn_protocols` in the `tls` module (thanks @technicianted!)
- Make logs a lot quieter
- Reorganize and update documentation
- Make sure that `ambassador dump --k8s` will work correctly

## [0.25.0] February 6, 2018
[0.25.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.23.0...v0.25.0

(Note that 0.24.0 was an internal release.)

## [0.23.0] January 17, 2018
[0.23.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.22.0...v0.23.0

### Changed

- Clean up build docs (thanks @alexgervais!)
- Support `add_request_headers` for, uh, adding requests headers (thanks @alexgervais!)
- Make end-to-end tests and Travis build process a bit more robust
- Pin to Kubernaut 0.1.39
- Document the use of the `develop` branch
- Don't default to `imagePullAlways`

## [0.22.0] January 17, 2018
[0.22.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.21.1...v0.22.0

### Changed

- Switched to using `quay.io` rather than DockerHub. **If you are not using Datawire's published Kubernetes manifests, you will have to update your manifests!**
- Switched to building over Alpine rather than Ubuntu. (We're still using an unstripped Envoy; that'll change soon.)
- Switched to a proper production configuration for the `statsd` pod, so that it hopefully chews up less memory.
- Make sure that Ambassador won't generate cluster names that are too long for Envoy.
- Fix a bug where Ambassador could crash if there were too many egregious errors in its configuration.

## [0.21.1] January 11, 2018
[0.21.1]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.21.0...v0.21.1

### Changed

- Ambassador will no longer generate cluster names that exceed Envoy's 60-character limit.

## [0.21.0] January 3, 2018
[0.21.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.20.1...v0.21.0

### Changed

- If `AMBASSADOR_SINGLE_NAMESPACE` is present in the environment, Ambassador will only look for services in its own namespace.
- Ambassador `Mapping` objects now correctly support `host_redirect`, `path_redirect`, `host_rewrite`, `auto_host_rewrite`, `case_sensitive`, `use_websocket`, `timeout_ms`, and `priority`.

## [0.20.1] December 22, 2017
[0.20.1]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.20.0...v0.20.1

### Changed

- If Ambassador finds an empty YAML document, it will now ignore it rather than raising an exception.
- Includes the namespace of a service from an annotation in the name of its generated YAML file.
- Always process inputs in the same order from run to run.

## [0.20.0] December 18, 2017
[0.20.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.19.2...v0.20.0

### Changed

- Switch to Envoy 1.5 under the hood.
- Refocus the diagnostic service to better reflect what's actually visible when you're working at Ambassador's level.
- Allow the diagnostic service to display, and change, the Envoy log level.

## [0.19.2] December 12, 2017
[0.19.2]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.19.1...v0.19.2

### Changed

- Arrange for logs from the subsystem that watches for Kubernetes service changes (kubewatch) to have timestamps and such.
- Only do new-version checks every four hours.

## [0.19.1] December 4, 2017
[0.19.1]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.19.0...v0.19.1

### Changed

- Allow the diag service to look good (well, OK, not too horrible anyway) when Ambassador is running with TLS termination.
- Show clusters on the overview page again.
- The diag service now shows you the "health" of a cluster by computing it from the number of requests to a given service that didn't involve a 5xx status code, rather than just forwarding Envoy's stat, since we don't configure Envoy's stat in a meaningful way yet.
- Make sure that the tests correctly reported failures (sigh).
- Allow updating out-of-date diagnostic reports without requiring multiple test runs.

## [0.19.0] November 30, 2017
[0.19.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.18.2...v0.19.0

### Changed

- Ambassador can now use HTTPS upstream services: just use a `service` that starts with `https://` to enable it.
  - By default, Ambassador will not offer a certificate when using HTTPS to connect to a service, but it is possible to configure certificates. Please [contact us on Slack](https://d6e.co/slack) if you need to do this.
- HTTP access logs appear in the normal Kubernetes logs for Ambassador.
- Itâ€™s now possible to tell `ambassador config` to read Kubernetes manifests from the filesystem and build a configuration from the annotations in them (use the `--k8s` switch).
- Documentation on using Ambassador with Istio now reflects Ambassador 0.19.0 and Istio 0.2.12.

## [0.18.2] November 28, 2017
[0.18.2]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.18.0...v0.18.2

[0.18.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.17.0...v0.18.0

### Changed

- The Host header is no longer overwritten when Ambassador talks to an external auth service. It will now retain whatever value the client passes there.

### Fixed

- Checks for updates werenâ€™t working, and they have been restored. At present youâ€™ll only see them in the Kubernetes logs if youâ€™re using annotations to configure Ambassador â€” theyâ€™ll start showing up in the diagnostics service in the next release or so.

## [0.17.0] November 14, 2017
[0.17.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.16.0...v0.17.0

### Changed

- Allow Mappings to require matches on HTTP headers and `Host`

### Changed

- Support configuring Ambassador via `annotations` on Kubernetes `service`s
- No need for volume mounts! Ambassador can read configuration and TLS-certificate information directly from Kubernetes to simplify your Kubernetes YAML
- Expose more configuration elements for Envoy `route`s: `host_redirect`, `path_redirect`, `host_rewrite`, `auto_host_rewrite`, `case_sensitive`, `use_websocket`, `timeout_ms`, and `priority` get transparently copied

### Fixed

- Reenable support for gRPC

## [0.15.0] October 16, 2017
[0.15.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.14.2...v0.15.0

### Changed

### Changed

- Declarative Ambassador! Configuration is now via YAML files rather than REST calls
- The `ambassador-store` service is no longer needed.

## [0.10.14] September 15, 2017
[0.10.14]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.10.13...v0.10.14

### Changed

- Properly support proxying all methods to an external authentication service, with headers intact, rather than moving request headers into the body of an HTTP POST.

## [0.10.12] August 2, 2017
[0.10.12]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.10.10...v0.10.12

### Changed

- Make TLS work with standard K8s TLS secrets, and completely ditch push-cert and push-cacert.

### Fixed

- Move Ambassador out from behind Envoy, so that you can use Ambassador to fix things if you completely botch your Envoy config.
- Let Ambassador keep running if Envoy totally chokes and dies, but make sure the pod dies if Ambassador loses access to its storage.

## [0.10.10] August 1, 2017
[0.10.10]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.10.7...v0.10.10

### Fixed

- Fix broken doc paths and simplify building as a developer. 0.10.8, 0.10.9, and 0.10.10 were all stops along the way to getting this done; hopefully we'll be able to reduce version churn from here on out.

## [0.10.7] July 25, 2017
[0.10.7]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.10.6...v0.10.7
