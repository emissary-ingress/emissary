# Changelog

## [0.20.0] December 18, 2017
[0.20.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.19.2...v0.20.0

### Changed

- Switch to Envoy 1.5 under the hood.
- Refocus the diagnostic service to better reflect what's actually visible when you're working at Ambassador's level.
- Allow the diagnostic service to display, and change, the Envoy log level.

## [0.19.2] December 12, 2017
[0.19.2]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.19.1...v0.19.2

### Changed

- Arrange for logs from the subsystem that watches for Kubernetes service changes (kubewatch) to have timestamps and such.
- Only do new-version checks every four hours.

## [0.19.1] December 4, 2017
[0.19.1]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.19.0...v0.19.1

### Changed

- Allow the diag service to look good (well, OK, not too horrible anyway) when Ambassador is running with TLS termination.
- Show clusters on the overview page again.
- The diag service now shows you the "health" of a cluster by computing it from the number of requests to a given service that didn't involve a 5xx status code, rather than just forwarding Envoy's stat, since we don't configure Envoy's stat in a meaningful way yet.
- Make sure that the tests correctly reported failures (sigh).
- Allow updating out-of-date diagnostic reports without requiring multiple test runs.

## [0.19.0] November 20, 2017
[0.19.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.18.2...v0.19.0

### Changed

- Ambassador can now use HTTPS upstream services: just use a `service` that starts with `https://` to enable it.
  - By default, Ambassador will not offer a certificate when using HTTPS to connect to a service, but it is possible to configure certificates. Please [contact us on Gitter](https://gitter.im/datawire/ambassador) if you need to do this.
- HTTP access logs appear in the normal Kubernetes logs for Ambassador.
- It’s now possible to tell `ambassador config` to read Kubernetes manifests from the filesystem and build a configuration from the annotations in them (use the `--k8s` switch).
- Documentation on using Ambassador with Istio now reflects Ambassador 0.19.0 and Istio 0.2.12.

## [0.18.2] November 20, 2017
[0.18.2]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.18.0...v0.18.2

### Changed

- The diagnostics service will now tell you when updates are available.

## [0.18.0] November 20, 2017
[0.18.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.17.0...v0.18.0

### Changed

- The Host header is no longer overwritten when Ambassador talks to an external auth service. It will now retain whatever value the client passes there.

### Fixed

- Checks for updates weren’t working, and they have been restored. At present you’ll only see them in the Kubernetes logs if you’re using annotations to configure Ambassador — they’ll start showing up in the diagnostics service in the next release or so.

## [0.17.0] November 14, 2017
[0.17.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.16.0...v0.17.0

### Changed

- Allow Mappings to require matches on HTTP headers and `Host`
- Update tests, docs, and diagnostic service for header matching

### Fixed

- Published YAML resource files will no longer overwrite annotations on the Ambassador `service` when creating the Ambassador `deployment`

## [0.16.0] November 10, 2017

### Changed

- Support configuring Ambassador via `annotations` on Kubernetes `service`s
- No need for volume mounts! Ambassador can read configuration and TLS-certificate information directly from Kubernetes to simplify your Kubernetes YAML
- Expose more configuration elements for Envoy `route`s: `host_redirect`, `path_redirect`, `host_rewrite`, `auto_host_rewrite`, `case_sensitive`, `use_websocket`, `timeout_ms`, and `priority` get transparently copied

### Fixed

- Reenable support for gRPC

## [0.15.0] October 16, 2017
[0.15.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.14.2...v0.15.0

### Changed

- Allow `docker run` to start Ambassador with a simple default configuration for testing
- Support `host_rewrite` in mappings to force the HTTP `Host` header value for services that need it
- Support `envoy_override` in mappings for odd situations
- Allow asking the diagnostic service for JSON output rather than HTML

- Support `cert_required` in TLS config

## [0.13.0] September 25, 2017
[0.13.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.12.1...v0.13.0

- Support using IP addresses for services.
- Check for collisions, so that trying to e.g. map the same prefix twice will report an error.
- Enable liveness and readiness probes, and have Kubernetes perform them by default.
- Document the presence of the template-override escape hatch.

## [0.12.1] September 22, 2017
[0.12.1]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.12.0...v0.12.1

## [0.12.0] September 21, 2017
[0.12.0]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.11.2...v0.12.0

- The `ambassador-store` service is no longer needed.

## [0.10.14] September 15, 2017
[0.10.14]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.10.13...v0.10.14

### Fixed

## [0.10.13] September 5, 2017
[0.10.13]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.10.12...v0.10.13

### Changed

- Properly support proxying all methods to an external authentication service, with headers intact, rather than moving request headers into the body of an HTTP POST.

## [0.10.12] August 2, 2017
[0.10.12]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.10.10...v0.10.12

### Changed

- Make TLS work with standard K8s TLS secrets, and completely ditch push-cert and push-cacert.

### Fixed

- Move Ambassador out from behind Envoy, so that you can use Ambassador to fix things if you completely botch your Envoy config.
- Let Ambassador keep running if Envoy totally chokes and dies, but make sure the pod dies if Ambassador loses access to its storage.

[0.10.10]: https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/compare/v0.10.7...v0.10.10

### Fixed

- Fix broken doc paths and simplify building as a developer. 0.10.8, 0.10.9, and 0.10.10 were all stops along the way to getting this done; hopefully we'll be able to reduce version churn from here on out.
